        How is a movie based on a video game more soulless than the game itself? The knock against the world of gaming
        has long
        been that they lack a human element, but Ruben Fleischer’s “Uncharted” feels emptier than the award-winning
        franchise on
        which it’s based. Dominated by green screen special effects and thin treasure-hunt plotting, “Uncharted”
        fundamentally
        lacks the sense of adventure that turned the Sony games into some of the most beloved of all time. What’s most
        startling
        is how much the games themselves feel more cinematic in terms of world building, character, and narrative than
        the
        actual movie. It’s not quite as disastrous as some video game adaptations, and it’s at least light enough on its
        feet to
        never insult the intelligence of its fan base as so many of these movies tend to do. However, “Uncharted” seems
        to want
        to ride the goodwill of the video game adventures of Nathan Drake more than create any of its own; it takes no
        risks and
        feels like a bare minimum effort in terms of storytelling. Roger famously said that video games can never be
        art. The
        ones on which this movie is based are certainly more artistic.
    </p>


    <p>
        Nathan Drake (Tom Holland) was conceived as a throwback to Indiana Jones and the serial adventure films that
        inspired
        him. He should be a smooth-talking treasure hunter, someone who exists in a slightly gray moral area wherein
        stealing
        priceless artifacts is warranted because no one else can really appreciate them like Drake. Holland has the
        agility but
        quite simply lacks the weight and world-weariness needed for a character like Drake, who was raised in an
        orphanage and
        is willing to steal to make ends meet. If Indiana was typically the smartest person in a room, Drake needs to be
        the one
        with the sharpest instincts, someone who sees the puzzles of history from a place of expertise and courage.
        Holland is a
        smart actor, but he’s just wrong here, always looking a little bit like a kid dressing up as his favorite video
        game
        character.
    </p>

    <p>
        While working at a bar and stealing jewelry from his patrons, Drake is approached by Victor Sullivan aka Sully
        (Mark
        Wahlberg), who tells him that he got close to one of the most famous lost treasures in history with Nathan’s
        brother
        Sam. They stole the diary of the famous explorer Juan Sebastian Elcano, which will guide them to treasure that
        was
        hidden by the Magellan expedition. They quickly cross paths with Santiago Moncada (an Antonio Banderas so
        underutilized
        that one has to believe half his part was cut), the heir to the family that funded the original expedition.
        Moncada’s
        will is enforced by the tough Jo Braddock (Tati Gabrielle) and the boys reunite with an old colleague of Sully’s
        in
        Barcelona named Chloe Frazier (Sophia Ali, who pretty much steals the movie).
    </p>


    <p>
        “Uncharted” bounces these characters off each other on a journey to Spain and the Philippines, but nothing has
        any
        weight to it. It’s green screen performing that ignores how much setting can matter in a film like this one.
        Design
        never once feels like a consideration, whether Nathan and Chloe are crawling through a nondescript tunnel to
        hidden
        treasure or Sully is getting into one of the few fight scenes in an actual Papa John’s. A film like “Uncharted”
        needs to
        transport audiences. We need to go on the journey, not just watch actors pretend to fall out of planes. The
        “Uncharted”
        games take players around the world. You’ll never once get that feeling during this cold, distant adventure
        film.
    </p>


    <p>
        If anything saves “Uncharted” from the depths of the worst video game adaptations, it’s the relative charm of
        the cast.
        Holland may be miscast, but he’s just an incredibly likable movie star, and I hope he can find parts that better
        utilize
        his charms. Wahlberg creates a nice balance between his charisma and the exhausted tone of a treasure hunter who
        has
        seen and done enough, and just wants that final gig that can set him up for life. Banderas is wasted and
        Gabrielle is
        inconsistent, but Ali is arguably the one performer who gets that “Uncharted” should be fun. She gives the film
        some
        much-needed energy and unpredictability when she's on-screen.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Uncharted” is another one of those projects that has been through so many potential production teams over the
        years
        that it lost its identity. There are reports going back to 2008 about different filmmakers trying to get this
        movie made
        and David O. Russell, Neil Burger, Joe Carnahan, Shawn Levy, Dan Trachtenberg, and Travis Knight were all
        rumored or
        even attached at different points. When a project goes through so many iterations over the years, it can often
        lead to a
        final film that feels like a compromise, a watered-down version that took the most common, most basic elements
        of
        everything that had been suggested over the years. “Uncharted” checks boxes for fans and newbies but does so in
        such a
        predictable manner that it lacks any edge or spark. I’ve played through some of the “Uncharted” games from
        beginning to
        end more than once, a multiple-hour commitment. It may only take two to watch it, but I’ll probably never see
        this movie
        again.
