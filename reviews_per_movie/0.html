        In "Top Gun: Maverick," the breathless, gravity and logic-defying "Top Gun" sequel that somehow makes all
        the sense
        in the world despite landing more than three decades after the late Tony Scott's original, an admiral refers
        to Tom
        Cruise's navy aviator Pete Mitchell—call sign "Maverick"—as "the fastest man alive." It's a chuckle-inducing
        scene
        that recalls one in "Mission: Impossible – Rogue Nation," when Alec Baldwin's high-ranking Alan Hunley deems
        Cruise's Ethan Hunt, "the living manifestation of destiny." In neither of these instances are Cruise's
        co-stars
        exclusively referring to his make-believe screen personas. They are also (or rather, primarily) talking
        about the
        ongoing legacy of Cruise the actor himself.
    </p>


    <p>
        Truth be told, our fearless and ever-handsome action hero earns both appraisals with a generous side of
        applause,
        being one of the precious remnants of bona-fide movie superstardoms of yore, a slowly dwindling
        they-don't-make-'em-like-they-used-to notion of immortality these days. Indeed, Cruise's consistent
        commitment to
        Hollywood showmanship—along with the insane levels of physical craft he unfailingly puts on the table by
        insisting
        to do his own stunts—I would argue, deserves the same level of high-brow respect usually reserved for the
        fully-method sorts such as Daniel Day-Lewis. Even if you somehow overlook the fact that Cruise is one of our
        most
        gifted and versatile dramatic and comedic actors with the likes of "Born on the Fourth of July," "Magnolia,"
        "Tropic
        Thunder," and "Collateral" under his belt, you will never forget why you show up to a Tom Cruise movie,
        thanks in
        large part to his aforesaid enduring dedication. How many other household names and faces can claim to
        guarantee "a
        singular movie event" these days and deliver each time, without exceptions?
    </p>

    <p>
        In that regard, you will be right at home with "Top Gun: Maverick," director Joseph Kosinski's witty
        adrenaline
        booster that allows its leading producer to be exactly what he is—a star—while upping the emotional and
        dramatic
        stakes of its predecessor with a healthy (but not overdone) dose of nostalgia. After a title card that
        explains what
        "Top Gun" is—the identical one that introduced us to the world of crème-de-la-crème Navy pilots in 1986—we
        find
        Maverick in a role on the fringes of the US Navy, working as an undaunted test pilot against the familiar
        backdrop
        of Kenny Loggins' "Danger Zone." You won't be surprised that soon enough, he gets called on a one-last-job
        type of
        mission as a teacher to a group of recent Top Gun graduates. Their assignment is just as obscure and
        politically
        cuckoo as it was in the first movie. There is an unnamed enemy—let's called it Russia because it's probably
        Russia—some targets that need to be destroyed, a flight plan that sounds nuts, and a scheme that will
        require all
        successful Top Gun recruits to fly at dangerously low altitudes. But can it be done?
    </p>



    <p>
        It's a long shot, if the details of the operation—explained to the aviator hopefuls in a rather "It can't be
        done"
        style reminiscent of "Mission: Impossible"—are any indication. But you will be surprised that more appealing
        than
        the prospect of the bonkers mission here is the human drama that co-scribes Ehren Kruger, Eric Warren
        Singer, and
        Christopher McQuarrie spin from a story by Peter Craig and Justin Marks. For starters, the group of
        potential
        recruits include Lt. Bradley "Rooster" Bradshaw (Miles Teller, terrific), the son of the dearly departed
        "Goose,"
        whose accidental death still haunts Maverick as much as it does the rest of us. And if Rooster's
        understandable
        distaste of him wasn't enough (despite Maverick's protective instincts towards him), there are skeptics of
        Maverick's credentials—Jon Hamm's Cyclone, for instance, can't understand why Maverick's foe-turned-friend
        Iceman
        (Val Kilmer, returning with a tearjerker of a part) insists on him as the teacher of the mission. Further
        complicating the matters is Maverick's on-and-off romance with Penny Benjamin (a bewitching Jennifer
        Connelly), a
        new character that was prominently name-checked in the original movie, as some will recall. What an
        entanglement
        through which one is tasked to defend their nation and celebrate a certain brand of American pride ...
    </p>



    <p>
        In a different package, all the brouhaha jingoism and proud fist-shaking seen in "Top Gun: Maverick" could
        have been
        borderline insufferable. But fortunately Kosinski—whose underseen and underrated "Only The Brave" will
        hopefully
        find a second life now—seems to understand exactly what kind of movie he is asked to navigate. In his hands,
        the
        tone of "Maverick" strikes a fine balance between good-humored vanity and half-serious self-deprecation,
        complete
        with plenty of quotable zingers and emotional moments that catch one off-guard.
    </p>

    <p>
        In some sense, what this movie takes most seriously are concepts like friendship, loyalty, romance, and
        okay,
        bromance. Everything else that surrounds those notions—like patriotic egotism—feels like playful winks and
        embellishments towards fashioning an old-school action movie. And because this mode is clearly shared by the
        entirety of the cast—from a memorable Ed Harris that begs for more screen time to the always great Glen
        Powell as
        the alluringly overconfident "Hangman," Greg Tarzan Davis as "Coyote," Jay Ellis as "Payback," Danny Ramirez
        as
        "Fanboy," Monica Barbaro as "Phoenix," and Lewis Pullman as "Bob"—"Top Gun: Maverick" runs fully on its
        enthralling
        on-screen harmony at times. For evidence, look no further than the intense, fiery chemistry between Connelly
        and
        Cruise throughout—it's genuinely sexy stuff—and (in a nostalgic nod to the original), a rather sensual beach
        football sequence, shot with crimson hues and suggestive shadows by Claudio Miranda.
    </p>



    <p>
        Still, the action sequences—all the low-altitude flights, airborne dogfights as well as Cruise on a
        motorcycle
        donned in his original Top Gun leather jacket—are likewise the breathtaking stars of "Maverick," often
        accompanied
        by Harold Faltermeyer's celebratory original score (aided by cues from Hans Zimmer and Lorne Balfe).
        Reportedly, all
        the flying scenes—a pair of which are pure hell-yes moments for Cruise—were shot in actual U.S. Navy
        F/A-18s, for
        which the cast had to be trained for during a mind-boggling process. The authentic work that went into every
        frame
        generously shows. As the jets cut through the atmosphere and brush their target soils in close-shave
        movements—all
        coherently edited by Eddie Hamilton—the sensation they generate feels miraculous and worthy of the biggest
        screen
        one can possibly find. Equally worthy of that big screen is the emotional strokes of "Maverick" that pack an
        unexpected punch. Sure, you might be prepared for a second sky-dance with "Maverick," but perhaps not one
        that might
        require a tissue or two in its final stretch.

        Available in theaters May 27th.
