        If he thought about it, Briggs (Channing Tatum) might believe that the injuries from his service as an Army
        Ranger have
        taken everything he had and everything he needed. But he does not think about it. Despite his doctor’s warnings
        that he
        has some permanent impairment, he's determined to get back into the Rangers. Service gives him structure,
        purpose,
        fellowship, and enough adrenaline to not have to think about the many things he doesn't want to think about,
        including
        how much more there is still to lose.
    </p>

    <p>
        Briggs needs sign-off from an officer to be readmitted to the Rangers, who call themselves “the Army's premier
        direct-action raid force.” He has been repeatedly turned down. Finally, an officer says he will authorize
        Briggs’
        reinstatement if he will perform one task, delivering an Army dog to the funeral of a veteran who served with
        Briggs.
        The dog is Lulu, a sweet-faced Belgian Malinois who performed many brave rescue operations, but who now is so
        severely
        traumatized from being in a war zone that no one can go near her. She has sent three people to the emergency
        room and
        been deemed un-salvageable. Until the funeral, she is muzzled and on Prozac. After the funeral, she is scheduled
        to be
        put down.
    </p>

    <p>
        Briggs, who has said he would do anything to get back into the service, does not want to do this. “You’re asking
        me to
        take a dog on a plane to Arizona?” The officer responds, “I’m asking you to drive a Ranger to a funeral.” The
        dog is too
        unstable to fly; indeed, Briggs is warned not to let her near any person or animal. But if Briggs can deliver
        Lulu with
        no mistakes and no trouble, he can get the approval he needs.
    </p>


    <p>
        Of course, there will be mistakes and there will be trouble on the road from Oregon to Arizona by way of Los
        Angeles.
        There will also be connections from the past, both in person and via an extensive, heartfelt, and very detailed
        notebook
        kept by Lulu’s Ranger handler.
    </p>

        Tatum the actor responds exceptionally well to Tatum the co-director (along with co-screenwriter Reid Carolin,
        both
        directing a feature for the first time). In his previous films, Tatum has mostly relied on his natural
        all-American
        charm, a boy-we’d-like-to-have-next-door combination of confident strength and self-deprecating humor. We have
        seen him
        unhappy and under stress but almost always as a character who keeps those feelings hidden. Here we see his
        range, with
        more vulnerability than he has shown on screen before. Briggs tries his utmost to hide his struggle from
        everyone,
        including himself. But Tatum lets us see it, without consideration for movie star vanity.
    </p>


    <p>
        Carolin and Tatum play it safe in some other choices, though, with too many sun flares and postcard-pretty shots
        of the
        beautiful western countryside and some on-the-nose song selections for the soundtrack. We do not need to hear
        Kenny
        Rogers singing “The Gambler” again; when it comes to that song, it is time to fold ‘em. One of the stops on the
        road
        trip is in Portland, and the tired jokes about too-twee Portlandia-ness and Briggs’ efforts to adapt in order to
        get
        laid wear thin fast.
    </p>

    <p>
        What we’re there to see is two wounded warriors, one human, one canine, heal each other, and that works well.
        There are
        some surprising detours along the way, with some characters more interesting than the crunchy Portlandians. The
        always-welcome Jane Adams brings her delicate sensibility to a character who could easily have been caricatured.
        Interactions with two other vets also benefit from thoughtful performances.
    </p>


    <p>
        Both Briggs and Lulu learn that the skills they relied on in the military might need to be un-learned, or at
        least kept
        in check. Lulu knocks down a man in a hotel lobby only because he is wearing Middle Eastern robes. Briggs learns
        that
        perhaps you don’t enter someone’s property the way you enter enemy territory, even if you think your dog might
        be there.
        They also learn that those skills can have some value in a civilian life, as long as Briggs and Lulu learn to
        think
        differently about what they are trying to accomplish with them.
    </p>

    <p>
        “Dog” is uneven in tone and quality but shows promise in the way Tatum and Carolin approach the story with care
        and
        heart. It leaves us optimistic for the future ahead for the wounded warriors and for the people who told their
        story.
