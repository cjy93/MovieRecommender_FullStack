        “The Lost City” isn’t an especially unique film; its premise draws on “Romancing the Stone” and countless other
        adventure movies. Its punchlines are recognizable from a distance as the volcano dominating the remote island
        where most
        of the story takes place. This is a movie you can get a clear sense of from its opening moments, every beat
        clearly
        telegraphed.
    </p>

    <p>
        There is, however, a significant amount of comfort and delight in all this familiarity. Directors and co-writers
        Adam
        and Aaron Nee understand exactly what their audience wants—much like a good romance novelist might—and deliver
        an
        undeniably charming (and refreshingly IP-free) romantic romp. This is a movie you watch in the theater, with
        popcorn,
        then again and again on streaming, with a glass of wine.
    </p>

    <p>
        Loretta Sage (Sandra Bullock) is a burnt-out romance writer whose grief after the loss of her husband threatens
        to
        derail her career. Her disdain for her books is only matched by her dislike of their cover model, Alan (Channing
        Tatum),
        a seemingly dim beefcake who indulges her readers at signing events.
    </p>

    <p>
        After an event promoting her latest book, Loretta is abducted by explorer/rich guy Abigail (it’s a
        gender-neutral name,
        apparently) Fairfax, played by Daniel Radcliffe. Fairfax knows that the lost city from Loretta’s book is real,
        and he
        wants her to translate some ancient writing that leads to a treasure before a volcano erupts and covers the
        whole thing.
        Alan mounts an ill-advised expedition to save Loretta, with help from his meditation guru, Jack (Brad Pitt), and
        Loretta’s beleaguered editor Beth (Da’Vine Joy Randolph).
    </p>


    <p>
        Loretta and Alan’s eventual romance is unavoidable, but “The Lost City” does a great job exploring the mounting
        chemistry between Bullock and Tatum’s characters. In particular, the movie highlights Alan’s emotional
        intelligence and
        unwavering support. He may be the kind of guy who refers to Loretta as a “human mummy,” but he also knows she
        gets
        cranky without snacks, and that she could use a slightly more sensible pair of shoes traversing all that rocky
        terrain.
        Like many a beloved romantic hero, Alan is not only a gorgeous man, he’s a man who cares.
    </p>

    <p>
        Tatum is great casting for a role like this on several levels; not only does he look like he belongs on the
        cover of a
        romance paperback, he’s also an actor who understands his own appeal and has proven time and again that he isn’t
        afraid
        to play it for laughs. Bullock is also more than happy to play into her character’s physical awkwardness and
        eventual
        shedding of her prickly exterior—it’s not exactly unfamiliar territory for her, either. Together, the pair exude
        fun and
        a sense of affection that’s easy to get caught up in.
    </p>


    <p>
        Other members of the supporting cast, particularly a very welcome Patti Harrison as Loretta’s hysterically
        self-involved
        social media manager, add bright, bizarre punches of humor to a script that otherwise plays it by the numbers
        (oddly,
        this isn’t a criticism, “The Lost City” is working with an effective formula). Radcliffe is the only element of
        the
        movie that doesn’t work quite as well as the rest. His character is the one area where the film tries to change
        up
        established archetypes, and the result is that he feels out of place in a story where everyone else comfortably
        fits
        into their roles.
    </p>

    <p>
        “The Lost City” may get dinged by some for being formulaic and silly, but it does many things well that are
        notable.
        It’s bright, both visually and atmospherically. It’s an original story, told by filmmakers who get what kind of
        movie
        this is. Most importantly, its central relationship displays a real understanding of the emotional sensitivity
        and
        vulnerability that make romance attractive as a genre. Ultimately, “The Lost City” is interested in hitting
        viewers’
        expectations head on. It does so on a level that may seem obvious, but is done with an amount of care that’s
        sure to
        hold up to repeat viewings.
