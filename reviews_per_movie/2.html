        Matt Reeves' "The Batman" isn't a superhero movie. Not really. All the trappings are there: the Batmobile, the
        rugged
        suit, the gadgets courtesy of trusty butler Alfred. And of course, at the center, is the Caped Crusader himself:
        brooding, tormented, seeking his own brand of nighttime justice in a Gotham City that's spiraling into squalor
        and
        decay.
    </p>

    <p>
        But in Reeves' confident hands, everything is breathtakingly alive and new. As director and co-writer, he's
        taken what
        might seem like a familiar tale and made it epic, even operatic. His "Batman" is more akin to a gritty, '70s
        crime drama
        than a soaring and transporting blockbuster. With its kinetic, unpredictable action, it calls to mind films like
        "The
        Warriors" as well as one of the greatest of them all in the genre, "The French Connection." And with a series of
        high-profile murders driving the plot, it sometimes feels as if the Zodiac killer is terrorizing the citizens of
        Gotham.
    </p>


    <p>
        And yet, despite these touchstones, this is unmistakably a Matt Reeves film. He accomplishes here what he did
        with his
        gripping entries in the "Planet of the Apes" franchise: created an electrifying, entertaining spectacle, but one
        that's
        grounded in real, emotional stakes. This is a Batman movie that's aware of its own place within pop culture, but
        not in
        winking, meta fashion; rather, it acknowledges the comic book character's lore, only to examine it and reinvent
        it in a
        way that's both substantial and daring. The script from Reeves and Peter Craig forces this hero to question his
        history
        as well as confront his purpose, and in doing so, creates an opening for us as viewers to challenge the
        narratives we
        cling to in our own lives.
    </p>

        And with Robert Pattinson taking over the role of Bruce Wayne, we have an actor who's not just prepared but
        hungry to
        explore this figure's weird, dark instincts. This is not the dashing heir to a fortune prowling about, kicking
        ass in a
        cool costume. This is Travis Bickle in the Batsuit, detached and disillusioned. He's two years into his tenure
        as
        Batman, tracking criminals from on high in Wayne Tower—an inspired switch from the usual sprawl of Wayne Manor,
        suggesting an even greater isolation from society. "They think I'm hiding in the shadows," he intones in an
        opening
        voiceover. "But I am the shadows." In the harsh light of day, Pattinson gives us hungover indie rock star vibes.
        But at
        night, you can see the rush he gets from swooping in and executing his version of vengeance, even beneath the
        tactical
        gear and eye black.
    </p>


    <p>
        As he's shown in pretty much every role he's taken since "Twilight" made him a global superstar in 2008, working
        with
        singular auteurs from David Cronenberg to Claire Denis to the Safdie brothers, Pattinson is at his best when
        he's
        playing characters who make you uncomfortable. Even more than Christian Bale in the role, Pattinson is so
        skilled at
        making his beautiful, angular features seem unsettling. So when he first spies on the impossibly sexy Zoe
        Kravitz as
        Selina Kyle, slinking into her leather motorcycle gear and shimmying down the fire escape in her own pursuit of
        nocturnal justice, there's an unmistakable flicker of a charge in his eyes: Ooh. She's a freak like me.
    </p>


    <p>
        Pattinson and Kravitz have insane chemistry with each other. She is his match, physically and emotionally, every
        step of
        the way. This is no flirty, purring Catwoman: She's a fighter and a survivor with a loyal heart and a strong
        sense
        of
        what's right. Following her lead role in Steven Soderbergh's high-tech thriller "Kimi," Kravitz continues to
        reveal
        a
        fierce charisma and quiet strength.

    </p>
    <p>
        She's part of a murderer's row of supporting performers, all of whom get meaty roles to play. Jeffrey Wright is
        the
        rare
        voice of idealism and decency as the eventual Commissioner Gordon. John Turturro is low-key chilling as crime
        boss
        Carmine Falcone. Andy Serkis—Caesar in Reeves' "Apes" movies—brings a paternal wisdom and warmth as Alfred.
        Colin
        Farrell is completely unrecognizable as the sleazy, villainous Oswald Cobblepot, better known as The Penguin.
        And
        Paul
        Dano is flat-out terrifying as The Riddler, whose own drive for vengeance provides the story's spine. He goes to
        extremes here in a way that's reminiscent of his startling work in "There Will Be Blood." His derangement is so
        intense,
        you may find yourself unexpectedly laughing just to break the tension he creates. But there's nothing amusing
        about
        his
        portrayal; Dano makes you feel as if you're watching a man who's truly, deeply disturbed.
    </p>


    <p>
        This is not to say that "The Batman" is a downer; far from it. Despite the overlong running time of nearly three
        hours,
        this is a film that's consistently viscerally gripping. The coolest Batmobile yet—a muscular vehicle that's
        straight
        out
        of "Mad Max: Fury Road"—figures prominently in one of the movie's most heart-pounding sequences. It's an
        elaborate
        car
        chase and chain-reaction crash ending with an upside-down shot of fiery fury that literally had me applauding
        during
        my
        screening. During a fight at a thumping night club, punctuated by pulsating red lights, you can feel every punch
        and
        kick. (That's one of the more compelling elements of seeing this superhero in his early days: He isn't
        invincible.)
        And
        a shootout in a pitch-black hallway, illuminated only by the blasts of shotgun fire, is both harrowing and
        dazzling.
        Greatly magnifying the power of scenes like these is the score from veteran composer Michael Giacchino. Best
        known
        for
        his Pixar movie music, he does something totally different with "The Batman": percussive and horn-heavy, it is
        massive
        and demanding, and you will feel it deep in your core.

    </p>


    <p>
        Working with artists and craftspeople operating at the top of their game, Reeves has made a movie that manages
        to be
        ethereal yet weighty at the same time, substantial yet impressionistic. Cinematographer Greig Fraser pulls off
        the
        same
        sort of stunning magic trick he did with his Oscar-nominated work in Denis Villeneuve's "Dune": Through pouring
        rain
        and
        neon lights, there's both a gauziness and a heft to his imagery. His use of shadow and silhouette is masterful,
        and
        does
        so much to convey a sense of foreboding and tension. I could write an entire, separate essay on the film's many
        uses
        of
        the color red to suggest energy, danger, even hope. And the costume design from the great Jacqueline Durran—with
        Dave
        Crossman and Glyn Dillon designing Pattinson's rough-and-tumble Batsuit—put just the right finishing touch on
        the
        film's
        cool, edgy vibe.

    <p>This is the most beautiful Batman movie you've ever seen—even if it's not really a Batman movie at all.</p>
