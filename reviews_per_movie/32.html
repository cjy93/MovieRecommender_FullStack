        There’s a lot of pressure on Adrian Lyne’s “Deep Water,” a film that was basically dumped onto Hulu after Disney
        bought
        Fox and had no tolerance for a movie about horny people. Some corners of the internet have been anticipating
        this
        project as a return to “movies for adults,” a genre that has undeniably gone away in the studio production line
        now that
        almost every movie has to get a PG-13. And the fact that it’s the first film in two decades from the director of
        “Fatal
        Attraction” and “9 ½ Weeks” sets a standard for the film that might lead to disappointment. Will the “Make
        Movies Sexy
        Again” crowd give some of the storytelling bumps in “Deep Water” a pass or is this going to be further proof
        that the
        subgenre is creatively dead? Early reviews have already been divisive, and there’s no denying that some of this
        feels
        like it’s been through editing hell, especially the final act. I’m eager to see a reportedly longer version
        because
        there’s a lot here that works, including a great Ben Affleck performance and the kind of sexual tension that
        Americans
        simply don’t offer in the 2020s.
    </p>


    <p>
        Based on the 1957 novel by Patricia Highsmith, the genius who also wrote Strangers on a Train and The Talented
        Mr.
        Ripley, which should give you some idea of the games being played here, “Deep Water” doesn’t waste time with the
        “happy
        days” of the Van Allen union. We meet Vic Van Allen (Affleck) and his wife Melinda (Ana de Armas) deep in the
        misery of
        a failed partnership. They have stuck together, seemingly for their daughter Trixie (Grace Jenkins), but there
        seems to
        be little love that remains between the couple. The first extended scene takes place at a party, where Melinda
        gets very
        drunk and flirts with a handsome young man she personally invited to the soiree. In a moment alone together, Vic
        tells
        the new beau that he killed Melinda’s last lover, who's now missing. Is he kidding? The next day he claims that
        he is,
        but the basic machination of the script by Zach Helm (“Stranger Than Fiction”) and Sam Levinson (“Euphoria”) has
        been
        set in motion: Melinda cheats, and it’s possible that Vic kills the guys with whom Melinda cheats.
    </p>


    <p>
        That’s certainly what Don Wilson (Tracy Letts) thinks is happening, and the fact that he drives the plot is a
        weakness
        that Helm & Levinson don’t really take enough time selling. Why is this man devoting so much time and capital to
        his
        theory that Vic is a murderer? Near the end, he says something about a book, which could be the only reason, but
        there’s
        also an interesting beat when Don meets Vic and they get a little heated over how Van Allen made his money—the
        kind of
        drone technology that’s used in warfare. Has Vic always seen human life as disposable? There’s a fascinating
        thematic
        undercurrent in “Deep Water” about two people who may seem very different but are both users—Melinda uses men
        for
        pleasure and to provoke her husband. She says at one point that she does so because of the way they make her
        feel. These
        are selfish creatures, two people who give into basic instincts in ways that most moral people repress.
    </p>

    <p>
        Affleck nails this simmering selfishness perfectly, proving to be a great fit for the world of the writer who
        gave us
        Tom Ripley. There are echoes of Affleck's work in “Gone Girl” in how he captures Vic’s temperature, the way it
        rises
        every time he sees Melinda with a new lover, including ones played by Jacob Elordi and Finn Wittrock. Why
        doesn’t Vic
        just give up? The script, especially in its final act, hints at some darker themes that a longer version
        probably
        unpacks more but Affleck and De Armas sell this psychosexual dysfunction in a way that other performers would
        have
        missed. Lyne knows exactly how to use their physical beauty and sexual chemistry on-screen, reminding viewers
        how rarely
        we see this kind of thing between major movie stars. I’d also like to add that I thoroughly enjoy how often Lil
        Rel
        Howery keeps showing up lately and being so effective in relatively small parts (he delivers in two SXSW films
        this year
        too, “I Love My Dad” and “Spin Me Round”). He’s turning into a notable asset for those looking to fill a
        skeptical
        supporting role.
    </p>


    <p>
        While I suspect the abrupt, choppy ending (with a ridiculous choice for the closing credits) will leave people
        angry,
        “Deep Water” had done enough before then to win me over. It’s really a vicious piece of work, a movie made by a
        filmmaker who is unafraid to see the primal, darker parts that beautiful people hide behind their gorgeous
        facades. It
        may not be the comeback that fans of Lyne’s were really hoping for, but it’s a reminder that this kind of movie
        can
        still get made today. Even if it may not be tomorrow.
