        Now that Nicolas Cage has had his stock upgraded as of late (thanks to his lovely performance in “Pig” and his
        self-aware turn in the recent “The Unbearable Weight of Massive Talent”), and Bruce Willis has retired, I
        suspect
        that Liam Neeson is going to be the next actor who finds himself in the critical crosshairs for doing far too
        many
        forgettable movies. His latest, “Memory,” is already his second such film in 2022, and since his list of
        upcoming
        projects on IMDb mentions titles like “Retribution,” “In the Land of Saints and Sinners,” “The Revenger” and
        “Cold
        Pursuit Sequel Project,” it doesn’t appear that he will be disembarking this particular gravy train anytime
        soon. To
        his credit, “Memory” is at least slightly more ambitious than most of the similar films Neeson has done
        recently.
        But it's certainly not enough to make you overlook how one of our most powerful actors is again wasting his time
        on
        the kind of half-baked thriller Charles Bronson used to crank out with depressing regularity during the waning
        days
        of his career.
    </p>

    <p>
        The time around, Neeson plays Alex Lewis, another expert hired killer with a particular set of skills. As this
        film
        opens, he's considering leaving the life behind after seeing signs of the Alzheimer’s that has already claimed
        his
        brother. Nevertheless, Alex accepts one final job in El Paso, in which he has to bump off two separate people
        and
        recover some important flash drives from the first victim. He pulls off the first hit easily enough but when he
        discovers that the second victim is a 12-year-old girl (Mia Sanchez), Alex refuses to pull the trigger and keeps
        the
        flash drives for himself as an insurance policy.
    </p>

    <p>
        Unfortunately, the girl had been pimped out by her father to a number of wealthy and powerful people, including
        the
        depraved son of powerful real estate developer Davana Sealman (Monica Bellucci), who put out the original hit in
        order to help her child evade justice. After tying up that loose end, she also calls for Alex to be killed. But
        even
        though he's slipping mentally, he's still skillful enough to evade her hired goons and kill everyone remotely
        connected to the crime. Alex also plants enough clues for an FBI task force led by Vincent Serra (Guy Pearce),
        who
        also tried to help the girl and feels guilty about what happened to her, to pursue him while always remaining
        one
        step ahead of them.
    </p>

        If the basic story points of “Memory” sound familiar to you, it may be that you've seen “The Memory of a
        Killer,”
        the 2003 Belgian crime drama that has been Americanized here (with both films based on Jef Geeraerts’ novel The
        Alzheimer Case). Although this version more or less follows the same narrative path of its predecessor, the
        original
        film, although a perfectly good genre film in its own right, was more interested in its central character
        (played in
        a very good performance by Jan Decleir) as he is forced to reckon with both the weight of his past misdeeds and
        the
        cruelties of his present condition.
    </p>


    <p>
        “Memory” does begin to work when Neeson gets a hold of script's more dramatically impactful moments, but these
        scenes are simply too few and far between to be truly effective. Dario Scardapane’s screenplay tends to put more
        of
        an emphasis on the big action beats, which are implausible enough as is and doubly so when you consider that
        they
        involve a character with deteriorating cognitive abilities. Although these scenes are handled with some style by
        director Martin Campbell, whose oeuvre includes one of the very best James Bond films (“Casino Royale”) and a
        lot of
        stuff that will be politely overlooked here, they wind up overwhelming the human drama involving Neeson’s
        character.
        This is especially evident during a new, less thoughtful finale in which one of the key villains is dispatched
        in an
        especially gruesome manner in order to give the gorehounds in the audience a final thrill before the end
        credits.
        Other than Neeson, the only performance of note here comes from Bellucci, whose casting here is unexpected, to
        say
        the least.
    </p>


    <p>
        “Memory” is a little better than the majority of Neeson’s recent action excursions and there's a chance it may
        prove
        to be better than most of his future projects. However, that doesn't prove to be enough to make it worth
        watching,
        and those lucky enough to have seen “The Memory of a Killer” are likely to be disappointed as well. Yes, a
        little
        more effort has gone into the making of "Memory," so it's a shame—and an ironic one to boot—that the end results
        are
        so forgettable.
