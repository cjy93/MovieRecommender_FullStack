        When Lightyear was announced during Disney Investor Day 2020, I was skeptical. I remember laughing out loud
        because the
        concept of this movie was outrageous to me. A sci-fi action movie about Buzz Lightyear, the action hero that the
        toy was
        based on? Sure, whatever you say, Pixar. None of the trailers I saw until the film’s release left much of an
        impression
        on me. Sadly, the movie isn’t any better.
    </p>


    <p>
        A sci-fi action-adventure and the definitive origin story of Buzz Lightyear, the hero who inspired the toy,
        Lightyear
        follows the legendary Space Ranger after he’s marooned on a hostile planet 4.2 million light-years from Earth
        alongside
        his commander and their crew. As Buzz tries to find a way back home through space and time, he’s joined by a
        group of
        ambitious recruits and his charming robot companion cat, Sox. Complicating matters and threatening the mission
        is the
        arrival of Zurg, an imposing presence with an army of ruthless robots and a mysterious agenda.

        For this being Pixar veteran Angus MacLane’s directorial debut, I commend him for the ambitious scope he took to
        make
        Buzz Lightyear’s world unique and vast. It attempts to evoke a classic sci-fi style reminiscent of every sci-fi
        epic
        action film from the ‘70s and ‘80s, including Star Wars, Alien, and 2001: A Space Odyssey, to name a few.
        Lightyear
        tries to stand amongst them instead of imitating them. The film excels from that standpoint. It somehow manages
        to have
        its cake and eat it too by being visually unique while wearing its influences on its sleeve.
    </p>


    <p>
        The style blends the likes of futurism through the various color hues utilized in the exterior locations and
        surrealism
        through its live-action-like cinematography. All of the locations have an eerie atmosphere that elevates their
        identity
        while incorporating distinguished lighting and lens flares that would make a sci-fi nut go crazy. MacLane said,
        “Hey,
        what if we made an animated movie that was meant to look like live-action in the Toy Story universe?” It’s like
        a Pixar
        Dune. Lightyear stands its ground, boasting incredible visuals that are oftentimes breathtaking. Watch this
        movie in the
        biggest format possible so you can bask in the massive scale and scope the animators crafted to make this an
        epic in
        every sense of the word.
    </p>

        The film prefaces with text that says, “In 1995, Andy saw a Buzz Lightyear movie, which made him obsessed with
        the
        character. So we made that movie.” Upon watching the movie, I’d say Buzz is the least compelling character here.
        If
        anything, the side characters, primarily Izzy Hawthorne (voiced by Keke Palmer) and Sox (voiced by Peter Sohn),
        steal
        the show and are the heroes to truly be obsessed with. Izzy’s arc is the strongest aspect as far as character
        development goes. Without giving too much away, most of her conflict stems from wanting to live up to her
        grandmother
        Felicia Hawthorne’s (Uzo Aduba) image. Since she was Buzz’s best friend and the only remnant of her legacy,
        there’s an
        overwhelming amount of pressure to live up to her Hawthrone name. Along with Izzy’s spunky can-do attitude, you
        just
        adore the heck out of her.
    </p>


    <p>
        Then you got Sox, the Meow-VP of the entire picture. Listen, I’m a cat person, so I have a bias towards any
        cat-like
        character. But man, this sentient robot cat is the best character in the movie! Sox is cute, funny, and helps
        move the
        plot forward instead of being a plot device. Man, what kind of dull kid Andy must’ve been to obsess over Buzz
        Lightyear
        when Sox is the best boy. Plus, Peter Sohn’s calm, nurturing voice mixed with an optimistic tone matches the
        adorable
        character design. I would love to own a Sox plushie right now, I am not joking.
    </p>


    <p>It’s been two long years since we saw a theatrical Pixar movie for reasons that shall not be named.</p>

    <p>
        After the last few Pixar films were relegated to Disney+, it felt refreshing to watch a new feature from the
        studio in a
        theater, the way the filmmakers intended. Granted, I got to see Turning Red at AMC Empire 25 during its one-week
        run––so
        Disney can get that Oscar eligibility–– but that’s neither here nor there. For this being Pixar’s grand return
        to
        theaters post-Onward, Lightyear’s lack of personality makes me wish it was released on Disney+.
    </p>


    <p>
        Do you see how I singled out Izzy and Sox as being the best characters in a movie called Lightyear? Well, that’s
        because
        Buzz doesn’t have much to him. While Chris Evans does a fine job voicing this cinematic iteration of the
        character, he’s
        as redundant as the Buzz we know and love when he was introduced in the first Toy Story. He's a by-the-book,
        independent
        hard-head who causes an entire ship of people in stasis pods to reset their lives off-world. For most of the
        movie, he’s
        stricken with regret for failing the mission. Outside of that, he’s not so interesting.
    </p>

    <p>
        If we’re playing in the ballpark of sci-fi action heroes, the characterization of Buzz is far removed from what
        young
        kids idolize in terms of personality. Protagonists such as Luke Skywalker had a longing for adventure, Marty
        McFly was a
        cool teen rebel, and most of them were charismatic. Buzz hardly exudes any of those expressions, but he’s a
        rationalizer
        with determination. It’s not enough to make him compelling or as engaging as either his toy Tim Allen
        counterpart or his
        animated series Patrick Warburton counterpart.
    </p>

    <p>
        Within the past few years (post-Toy Story 4), it felt as if the studio was entering a new director-driven era.
        With a
        central focus on letting filmmakers tell personalized stories that only that filmmaker can do, Lightyear’s
        narrative is
        a bit too calculated and watered down for its good. While films like Soul, Luca, and Turning Red allowed the
        storytellers to take risks, much of Lightyear is written in a derivative manner. Most of the dialogue retreads
        the
        situation at hand or regurgitates the message of teamwork constantly. The screenplay plays like a first draft
        that they
        rushed into production instead of doing punch-ups to give Buzz and the rest of the non-Sox side characters any
        agency.
        One of the side characters is voiced by Taika Waititi and he isn’t funny! How do you have Taika in your movie
        and he
        only makes me laugh once? At a certain point, it becomes clear that the appeal is designated towards a young
        audience.
        That’s fine and all, but Pixar has been taking chances on new stories and bringing them to the height of their
        creativity. So, watching them resort to something as mundane as Lightyear is disappointing. If anything, it
        harkened
        back to the dark era of the early 2010s when Cars 2 crashed the studio’s streak and made us take off our
        rose-colored
        glasses.
    </p>


    <p>
        Quick side note, I’m not fond of the message. Heck, three different messages are present and they’re all
        scattershot in
        execution. The one about teamwork is in your face throughout, the one about regret is not taken far enough, and
        the
        final one, that comes with the third-act twist, boils down to, “Hey, sometimes you have to take the L.” The way
        that
        becomes prominent in the finale is so muddled it leaves a sour aftertaste in your mouth.
    </p>


    <p>
        The ambitious scope director Angus MacLane achieved to make Lightyear a cinematic sci-fi epic for young
        audiences is
        jaw-dropping. Much like its titular lead though, the screenplay barely has a personality to match the exciting
        visuals.
        Apart from one incredible sequence and two great side characters, the muddled and calculated story prevents this
        from
        being more than an exercise of Pixar's lesser fares.
