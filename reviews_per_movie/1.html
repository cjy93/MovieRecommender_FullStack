        Few things in life are certain besides death, taxes, and maybe the never-ending task that is doing laundry.
        At least
        that's where the characters in writer/directors Daniel Kwan and Daniel Scheinert, collectively known as
        Daniels, new
        film "Everything Everywhere All at Once" find themselves initially. That is, until they take an emotional,
        philosophical, and deeply weird trip through the looking glass into the multiverse and discover metaphysical
        wisdom
        along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
        In this love letter to genre cinema, Michelle Yeoh gives a virtuoso performance as Evelyn Wang, a weary
        owner of a
        laundromat under IRS audit. We first meet her enjoying a happy moment with her husband Waymond (Ke Huy Quan)
        and
        their
        daughter Joy (Stephanie Hsu). We see their smiling faces reflected in a mirror on their living room wall. As
        the
        camera
        literally zooms through the mirror, Evelyn's smile fades, now seated at a table awash with business
        receipts. She's
        preparing for a meeting with an auditor while simultaneously trying to cook food for a Chinese New Year
        party that
        will
        live up to the high standards of her visiting father Gong Gong (James Hong, wiley as ever).
    </p>


    <p>
        On top of juggling her father's visit and the tax audit, Evelyn's sullen daughter Joy wants to bring her
        girlfriend
        Becky (Tallie Medel) to the party and her husband wants to talk about the state of their marriage. Just as
        Evelyn
        begins
        to feel overwhelmed by everything happening in her life she's visited by another version of Waymond from
        what he
        calls
        the Alpha verse. Here humans have learned to "verse jump" and are threatened by an omniverse agent of chaos
        known as
        Jobu Tupaki. Soon, Evelyn is thrust into a universe-hopping adventure that has her questioning everything
        she
        thought
        she knew about her life, her failures, and her love for her family.
    </p>

    <p>
        Most of the action is set in an IRS office building in Simi Valley (which, as a Californian, had me in
        stitches),
        where
        Evelyn must battle IRS agent Diedre (Jamie Lee Curtis, having the time of her life), a troop of security
        guards, and
        possibly everyone else she's ever met. Production designer Jason Kisvarday crafts a seemingly endless
        cubicle-filled
        office where everything from the blade of a paper trimmer to a butt plug shaped auditor of the year awards
        become
        fair
        game in a battle to save the universe.

    </p>


    <p>
        Editor Paul Rogers' breakneck pace matches the script's frenetic dialogue, with layers of universes
        simultaneously
        folding into each other while also propelling Evelyn's internal journey. Match cuts seamlessly connect the
        universes
        together, while playful cuts help emphasize the humor at the heart of the film.
    </p>

    <p>
        Born from choices both made and not made, each universe has a distinct look and feel, with winking film
        references
        ranging from "The Matrix" to "The Fall" to "2001: A Space Odyssey" to "In The Mood For Love" to
        "Ratatouille." Even
        Michelle Yeoh's own legacy finds its way into the film with loving callbacks to her Hong Kong action film
        days and
        the
        wuxia classic "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon." The fight sequences, choreographed by Andy and Brian Le,
        have a
        balletic
        beauty to them, wisely shot by cinematographer Larkin Seiple in wide shots allowing whole bodies to fill the
        frame.
    </p>


    <p>
        Yeoh is the anchor of the film, given a role that showcases her wide range of talents, from her fine martial
        art
        skills
        to her superb comic timing to her ability to excavate endless depths of rich human emotion often just from a
        glance
        or a
        reaction. She is a movie star and this is a movie that knows it. Watching her shine so bright and clearly
        having a
        ball
        brought tears to my eyes more than once.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just as Evelyn taps into Yeoh's iconography, facets of Waymond can be found throughout Quan's unique career.
        The
        comic
        timing from his childhood roles as Data in "The Goonies" and Short Round in "Indiana Jones and the Temple of
        Doom"
        echoes in Evelyn's nebbish husband. His work as a fight coordinator shows through in Alpha's slick action
        hero
        capable
        of using a fanny pack to take out a group of attackers. Even his time as an assistant director to Wong Kar
        Wai on
        "2046"
        can be found in the universe where he plays the debonair one who got away. Quan tackles these variations
        with
        aplomb,
        bringing pathos to each and serving as a gentle reminder that there's strength in kindness.
    </p>


    <p>

        As Evelyn and Waymond's relationship ebbs and flows in iterations through the multiverses, it's their
        daughter Joy
        who
        proves to be the lynchpin. In a true breakout performance from Stephanie Hsu, Joy represents a growing
        generational
        divide. Joy carries the weight of Evelyn's fractured relationship with her grandfather and the
        disappointments of an
        American dream unattained. Her queerness as foreign to her mother as the country was when she herself first
        arrived.
        Her
        aimlessness a greater disappointment because of all that Eveyln sacrificed for her to have more options in
        life than
        she
        did. This pressure manifests in a rebellion so great it stretches beyond the multiverses into a realm where
        a giant
        everything bagel looms like a black hole ready to suck everyone into the void.
    </p>

    <p>
        If the void arises from the compounding of generational trauma, the Daniels posit that it can be reversed
        through
        the
        unconditional love passed down through those same generations, if we choose compassion and understanding
        over
        judgment
        and rejection. Chaos reigns and life may only ever make sense in fleeting moments, but it's those moments we
        should
        cherish. Moments of love and camaraderie. Sometimes they happen over time. Sometimes they happen all at
        once.
