        It’s interesting that “No Exit,” premiering today on Hulu, was once scheduled for a theatrical release by Fox
        because it
        feels like the kind of thing that doesn’t play in multiplexes anymore. It’s got a low budget and only a couple
        familiar
        faces. The market has pushed this kind of thriller out, moving them to streamers like Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu.
        So Fox
        changing their mind after the Disney merger and pushing this to their streaming service makes sense. Gone are
        the days
        when one could stumble into something like “No Exit” on a rainy day without really knowing what it’s about,
        startled by
        its twists and turns. It reminded me a great deal of 2003’s “Identity,” another single-setting thriller with a
        modest
        budget that made $90 million in a very different era, or the films that typically starred Angelina Jolie or
        Ashley Judd
        based on books that everyone read on a beach a few years earlier. "No Exit" is imperfect and struggles to get
        going, but
        it's a grisly piece of work that earns your suspension of disbelief. If you’re a fan of those ‘00s standalone
        thrillers,
        check out "No Exit" before it gets crushed in the next wave of streaming content.

        Damien Power directs this adaptation of a thriller novel of the same name by Taylor Adams. It has the kind of
        beautifully simple set-up that this fan of Hitchcock and Christie loves. A woman named Darby Thorne (Havana Rose
        Liu)
        gets a call that her mother is in the hospital. She flees the rehab facility she’s in—a detail that adds to her
        vulnerability and sense of overall panic—to try and drive to get to her mother, despite the protestations of her
        sister.
        As he’s traveling through the treacherous Utah mountains, she hits a blizzard, forcing her off the road and into
        a rest
        stop to wait it out. There, she meets four other stranded travelers—Ash (Danny Ramirez), Lars (David Rysdahl),
        Ed
        (Dennis Haysbert), and Sandi (Dale Dickey). It seems mundane until Darby goes outside to get a signal and finds
        a
        kidnapped girl (Mila Harris) in a van. Whose van? One of the four people in the rest stop is a monster. Darby
        has to
        figure out who’s dangerous enough to kidnap a child and how she can save the girl in the middle of a snowstorm.

    <p>
        “No Exit” kind of blows up its premise early, revealing the kidnapper before the end of the first act, but don’t
        panic.
        This is the kind of script one would know is based on a novel without seeing the credits because it has about a
        half-dozen chapter-ending twists. Let’s just say there are a lot of secrets in that rest stop, and while some
        may be put
        off by the coincidences and contrivances, “No Exit” works better as it piles up the insanity. It’s one of those
        films
        that deftly teeters on the edge of utter nonsense, and the balancing act becomes part of the escapist fun. It
        helps that
        Power admirably holds it together in terms of craft, getting brutal enough to remind people that he made
        “Killing
        Ground” while also having a stronger eye than a lot of streaming original directors, especially in the chaotic
        final
        act.

        He’s also strong with his ensemble, never allowing Liu to devolve into histrionics but keeping her grounded in a
        believable performance. Haysbert and Dickey are both incredibly welcome character actors who add significant
        weight as a
        couple who may not know everything about one another. Ramirez and Rysdahl have very different energies, but
        Power and
        writers Andrew Barrer & Gabriel Ferrari lean into that and challenge preconceptions.
    </p>


    <p>
        It’s tempting to say that “No Exit” works best if you turn off your brain, and I feel like there’s a stronger
        version
        with sharper dialogue and a more pronounced sense of claustrophobic tension in terms of space. However, this is
        the kind
        of thing that’s harder to pull off than it looks. Trust me. I’ve seen so many forgettable thrillers on streaming
        services. And I have a feeling that’s where I’ll be watching a lot more.
