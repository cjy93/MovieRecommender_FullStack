        The 2022 version of “Scream” is a film for viewers raised on the 1996 version of “Scream” and its three sequels.
        Whereas
        the first script by Kevin Williamson turned the kind of conversations that fans had about John Carpenter and Wes
        Craven
        in school cafeterias and coffee houses into something daring and riveting, the new script by James Vanderbilt
        and Guy
        Busick exists in a world where those conversations happen on a much larger scale in Discord chats, Reddit
        threads, and
        fan conventions. It's a horror film for a world in which everyone has an opinion on horror films. Luckily, it
        smartly
        balances references to the original movies in a way that (mostly) avoids the self-aware smugness that has killed
        many a
        “re-quel,” delivering a product that feels consistent with the first four movies but distinct enough to have its
        own
        voice. Some of Craven’s craftsmanship and skill with performers is lacking here, but by the time the film is
        rising to
        the rafters in its bonkers final act, I don't think any of the true horror fans in the audience will care.

        Of course, “Scream” opens with a phone call—and, yes, it’s still a landline. Once again, a young woman home
        alone is
        forced to play movie trivia with a psychopath, but the manner in which this “Scream” will update the original is
        apparent early as Tara Carpenter (Jenna Ortega) says her favorite horror flick isn’t a slasher classic but an
        “elevated
        horror” film like “The Babadook.” How we define the horror genre has changed significantly in the last 25 years,
        as has
        the relationship between filmmakers, viewers, and even "true story" subject matter that creators mine for
        escapist
        entertainment. The characters in the new “Scream” don’t just all have the same genre movie knowledge of the
        original’s
        Randy Meeks, they would destroy him in a trivia contest.
    </p>

        Tara is attacked by someone wearing the Ghostface outfit from the in-universe “Stab” franchise, based on the
        Woodsboro
        murders committed by Stu Macher and Billy Loomis, but she survives, bringing her estranged sister Sam (Melissa
        Barrera)
        back from Modesto to their hometown. Much like Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) from the original, Sam has some
        dark
        family drama that forced her to leave her sister behind, but it feels like this new killer attacked Tara to get
        the big
        sis to come home. She brings her new beau Richie (Jack Quaid of "The Boys") along for the ride, even though he’s
        never
        seen a “Stab” movie. By the way, they’ve made eight “Stab” movies and the last one was particularly loathed by
        the fan
        base for reportedly betraying what worked about the franchise in the first place. Of course, Rian Johnson
        directed.
    </p>


    <p>
        Before Tara can even get out of the hospital, Ghostface is on a rampage, leading Sam and Richie to the man who
        they
        think can help them figure out who’s behind the mask this time: Deputy Dewey (a very effective David Arquette,
        given
        more dramatic beats than usual. I hope it leads to more work like it.) He calls Sid and texts Gale (Courteney
        Cox), and
        the world-famous trio is back in town before you know it, but directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett
        wisely
        don’t let them take over the narrative. They’re flavoring, a nod to the past instead of the whole meal like in
        some
        other re-quels. Think of them like the legacy characters in the Star Wars sequels—essential but not driving the
        story.
    </p>


    <p>
        No, the focus here is again on a group of young people who have seen enough “Stab” movies to know that the
        killer is
        probably one of their own. It doesn’t help that almost everyone in town has a connection to the original
        characters—ask
        the Strodes how well that usually goes in horror movies—such as Wes Hicks (Dylan Minnette), the son of Judy
        Hicks
        (Marley Shelton) from “Scream 4,” or Mindy Meeks-Martin (Jasmin Savoy Brown) and Chad Meeks-Martin (Mason
        Gooding),
        related to poor Randy. And then there’s Amber (Mikey Madison), the one who seems most protective of Tara and
        distrusting
        of Sam. As for Samantha, she has such a close relationship to one of the original characters that she
        hallucinates
        conversations with him (that have some dodgy CGI that make them less effective than they probably were on
        paper). One of
        these young people is probably a killer. Given the track record of this series, probably more than one.
    </p>

        What really matters to the success of this “Scream” is the manner in which Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett build to
        their
        truly effective set pieces. One in a darkly lit hospital has the violent energy of John Carpenter and the
        extended party
        sequence/climax—it always ends at a party—is wonderfully constructed, shot with fluid camerawork by Brett
        Jutkiewicz and
        tightly edited by Michael Aller. Brian Tyler’s score elevates the brutal violence in death sequences that don’t
        feel as
        casual or tongue-in-cheek as a lot of nostalgic horror tends to feel. So many movies like “Scream” wink at their
        audience and forget to be remotely scary. The new “Scream” tries to be an actual horror movie instead of just a
        meta
        reference to the genre.

        While this may not be a fair game to play, it’s impossible not to consider how the film would have differed if
        Craven
        had lived to make it himself. I do think that he would have drawn a few better performances from the young cast,
        who are
        all good enough but nowhere near as distinctly memorable as the original crew, sometimes leaning into
        melodramatic
        emotions in a way that Craven would have dialed down. On the other hand, the original trio are excellent,
        conveying the
        trauma of having to go through this nonsense again in a way that feels genuine. And what really matters is how
        much
        Bettinelli-Olpin and Gillett have learned from the Craven originals in terms of craft. Whereas Craven used
        visual
        references to masters like Hitchcock and Carpenter, the new filmmakers have Wes himself to use as a role model,
        and they
        undeniably get to the core of a lot of what he did best in both craft and genre deconstruction. After all,
        there’s a
        reason the film’s dedication reads “For Wes” and a scene near the end even uses the phrase “passing the torch.”
        I’m not
        sure about the latter but I’m confident that Wes would be impressed enough to consider it.
