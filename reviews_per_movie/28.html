        There’s a lot of discussion lately about the type of films that are released now and what it says about the
        future of
        movies. Is it true that all people will go to see in theaters are superhero movies and other familiar IP? If
        that’s the
        case, my suspicion is that films like “The Contractor” will become commonplace on streaming services. There’s
        ample
        evidence that programming old-fashioned series and movies—what could be called “dad product”—works to find an
        under-served, usually older fan base who can afford all the streamers. The success of shows like “Yellowstone”
        and
        “Bosch” means people will probably be drawn to an action movie that not only recalls the time that star Chris
        Pine
        played Jack Ryan but reunites the stars of “Hell or High Water.” Sadly, the promise of “The Contractor” fizzles
        after an
        intriguing set-up as the script feels beneath most of the people involved. The talented cast do just enough to
        make this
        one more forgettable than horrendous, which means “The Contractor 2” seems likely. And so many more movies like
        it. I
        hope some of them try harder.
    </p>


    <p>
        The always-solid Pine plays Special Forces Sergeant James Harper, an elite agent with a bum knee who gets
        discharged
        from the U.S. Army and watches the bills pile up with his wife Brianne (Gillian Jacobs). That’s when his former
        squadmate and good friend Mike (Ben Foster) reaches out with a proposal. Mike has been doing off-the-books
        operations
        for a veteran named Rusty Jennings (Kiefer Sutherland). The money is good, the jobs are quick, and it will give
        James
        purpose again while providing for his family. As Mike says, “We’re all just mercenaries in the end,” giving the
        opening
        act of “The Contractor” some weighty dramatic material that the rest of the film doesn’t fulfill. It’s easy to
        think
        about the last time Pine & Foster starred in a drama that hinged on the lie of the American Dream. If “Hell or
        High
        Water” was the Western version of that concept, this is the Tom Clancy-inspired one.
    </p>

    <p>
        The problem is that writer J.P. Davis and director Tarik Saleh seem afraid to do anything interesting or
        unexpected once
        they have their pieces in place. It’s not surprising at all that the mission that James and Mike are contracted
        for
        blows up in their face. And only people who have never seen a movie before will be surprised to learn that Rusty
        isn’t
        telling them everything they need to know. Ultimately, “The Contractor” becomes depressingly routine. The action
        isn’t
        interestingly staged, and the plot has less twists in its 100 minutes than your average single episode of a spy
        drama.
        It all feels like set-up, getting people ready for a series of a film franchise, but so narratively thin on its
        own that
        you could recount the plot in like 15 words or less.
    </p>


    <p>
        This all means that the cast has to do a lot of heavy lifting to get this bare-bones film to two stars, which
        they do.
        They’re the real mercenaries here as Pine finds a sadness that balances the heroic approach lesser actors would
        have
        taken and proves he still has great chemistry with Foster. Nina Hoss is sadly wasted in a small part but Eddie
        Marsan
        gets a great scene that breaks the tedium of the second half with its near-capture/escape structure as James
        tries to
        find his way home.
    </p>

    <p>
        Other than a remarkable lack of ambition, there’s nothing explicitly wrong or dreadful about “The Contractor.”
        It checks
        boxes for what feels like an older audience who misses the days when action movies were made about American
        heroes
        instead of super ones. Honestly, those movie watchers deserve better too.
