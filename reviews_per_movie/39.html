        The Stephen King novel on which the new version of “Firestarter” is based was published in 1980 during a phase
        of the
        horror master’s career in which the writer seemed fascinated by kids with inexplicable powers. Charlie, played
        by Drew
        Barrymore in the 1984 film and Ryan Kiera Armstrong in this one, is cut from similar cloth as Danny from “The
        Shining”
        and the title character in “Carrie”—people who discover they’re not like normal kids. There’s nothing scarier
        than an
        out-of-control child. Trust me. King’s work would inspire generations—Elle in “Stranger Things” owes a great
        deal to
        Charlie, for one—which made a remake of this 40-year-old tale of pyromania inevitable. And yet, once again,
        inevitability doesn’t equal creativity. So often remakes feel more like contractual requirements than artistic
        explorations or updates of timeless themes. There is no better recent example of this than “Firestarter,” a film
        that
        goes through the motions with such apathetic predictability and pure cinematic laziness that you may want to set
        whatever device you’re watching it on ablaze.

        This “Firestarter” opens with Charlie in school, not on the run like in the original. Of course, that’s going to
        lead to
        a brutal display of power. After a few close calls, Charlie kind of emerges like a phoenix after a dodgeball
        incident
        sends her emotions into the blazing category. The principal and teacher presume the fireball that came out of
        the
        bathroom stall was an explosive device, but mom and dad disagree on what to do next. You see, they have powers
        too,
        products of experiments from an MK Ultra type program run by something called The Shop. Dad Andy (Zac Efron,
        and, yes, I
        too feel ancient that Efron can now believably play a father) has an ability called “The Push,” which is
        basically mind
        control. His daughter’s powers seem amplified and uncontrollable. She even lashes out at her mother Vicky
        (Sydney
        Lemmon) with a telekinetic attack. Mom and dad are going to have to do something drastic to protect Charlie and
        themselves.

        Hiding in the shadows for years, The Shop emerges when Captain Hollister (Gloria Reuben) calls in a bounty
        hunter who
        can handle the Charlie situation “with discretion,” a morbid soul named John Rainbird (Michael Greyeyes),
        introduced
        brooding to emo rock, of course. He quickly gets to Charlie’s house, but the kid is being rewarded for nearly
        killing
        her mother with ice cream, of course. When Charlie and dad get home, they discover how hot it really is for them
        now and
        go on the run. Some screaming and explosions follow, along with a few attempts from dad to teach her how to
        control her
        powers. Mostly explosions, which look about as tactile as a TikTok filter.

        The Blumhouse model is to keep budgets low, but they usually hire directors and productions teams who can hide
        the
        corners being cut with clever filmmaking choices. Not this time. “Firestarter” just looks cheap—in most ways,
        cheaper
        than the 1984 version—with no memorable craft elements or decisions outside of a cool, ‘80s score from John
        Carpenter,
        Cody Carpenter, and Daniel Davies. The score deserved a movie that knew how to use it more effectively and with
        tighter
        visual language. Everything here is close-up, boring coverage in flatly written dialogue scenes, and the action
        is even
        worse. It’s often hard to decipher what the hell is happening when things are supposed to be getting intense and
        director Keith Thomas does a miserable job with geography (largely because of the close-up, reverse shot
        structure that
        never puts two people in a frame in a room).
    </p>

    <p>
        In a weird coincidence, there’s another film opening in some cities and on VOD this week about telekinetic kids
        called
        “The Innocents,” which Stephen King himself has praised, probably remembering a bit of that period when he too
        was
        fascinated by unpredictable little monsters. Find a way to watch that one instead.
