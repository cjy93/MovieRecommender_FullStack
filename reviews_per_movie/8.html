            Chip and Dale are smart candidates for a reboot—they're a recognizable cartoon Disney duo, even if one
            doesn't
            know
            their series, or have a nostalgia for them in the slightest. Plus, there's no massive fanbase that I can
            think
            of
            who
            would be insulted by it. All the better fit for a bromance, in which John Mulaney and Andy Samberg can voice
            Chip
            and
            Dale, respectively, as two estranged friends who reunite after their showbiz careers fizzle out when the
            actual
            show
            "Rescue Rangers" went off the air. This is a live-action reboot of sorts, complete with Chip being a '90s
            hand-drawn
            version who now sells insurance, while Samberg's Dale has become a self-designated hotshot after getting
            "CGI
            surgery."

        </p>

        <p>
            This movie is directed by Akiva Schaffer, and stars Andy Samberg voicing as Dale, so technically that makes
            it a
            Lonely
            Island movie (their third member, Jorma Taccone, does bit voice parts). That inherently raises the pedigree
            for
            it,
            especially with how they have previously parodied pop music and success in the past. But we're not so lucky
            this
            time,
            as this movie doesn't have enough of a distinct comic personality, despite some inspired additions to a "Who
            Framed
            Roger Rabbit?" or "Looney Tunes: Back in Action" premise.
        </p>

        <p>
            One such inspired idea is how this movie casually includes different eras and recognizable styles on
            animation,
            recognizing that we've all become historians in the industry, whether we realize it or not. For example,
            Seth
            Rogen
            plays a smushed-down viking character with "Polar Express" eyes, a wildly funny idea that low-key makes this
            movie
            about
            the ups and downs of animation—across all companies, not just Disney. And the movie also uses voice talents
            like
            that of
            Tress MacNeille, Jim Cummings, Jeff Bennett, and more, keeping the characters authentic, the talent
            recognized.
            But
            the
            funniest character is voiced by Tim Robinson of "I Think You Should Leave," and it's so surprising and sharp
            you
            wish
            there more jokes from wherever it originated.
        </p>


        <p>
            The film's savviness with its world-building makes all the more apparent how tame its plotting is, which
            puts
            Chip
            and
            Dale into a rote investigation story. At the least the premise is funny: former enchanted sweetheart Sweet
            Pete
            (Will
            Arnett) has been kidnapping characters and changing their physical features, "bootlegging" them for
            knock-offs.
            ("Lady
            and Tramp" has been remade as "Spaghetti Dogs.") With the help of a policewoman and superfan named Ellie
            (KiKi
            Layne),
            Chip 'n Dale investigate the kidnapping of their companion Monterey Jack (Eric Bana). They follow clues that
            lead
            them
            to shady characters like cheesemonger Bjornson (Keegan-Michael Key), and the Coca-Cola bear (voiced by
            Da'Vone
            McDonald).
        </p>


        <p>
            But the execution of all this, the best way to keep us engaged wth story, is lacking (even when
            cinematographer
            Larry
            Fong gives the progressively kooky events a couple explosive action sequences). When there's a joke bout a
            third-act
            twist being cliche, it's more like trying to cover the tracks. It doesn't help that the jokes not related to
            current
            properties just aren't funny or memorable.

        </p>
        <p>
            The Henson company tried something similar to this a few years ago with vats of bodily fluids in the
            godawful
            "The
            Happytime Murders." This movie isn't that bad, which is a plus. It's also better than the "Alvin and the
            Chipmunks"
            films, but it's still stuck in that usual spot animated movie spot of trying to make something "for kids,"
            with
            some
            irreverent references and deep cuts for the adults. Take away the cameos—in the recording booth, and
            animated
            on-screen—and you get something that's a little too close to the same old junk.
