            The modern Marvel sequel is as multi-armed as Doctor Strange casting a spell. Think about how many
            properties
            are
            being
            sequel-ed in "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness." It's a sequel to "Doctor Strange," although just
            barely
            in
            that you probably need to have seen that film less than the Strange adventures that followed. It's a sequel
            to
            "Avengers: Endgame" and "Spider-Man: No Way Home" in that it references action in both films and
            extrapolates
            somewhat
            on the universe-saving decision that the title character made in the former. It's very much a sequel to
            "WandaVision,"
            the show that expanded the Marvel Cinematic Universe into television. And, for a particular generation, it's
            kind of
            a
            sequel to when Sam Raimi was one of the most badass filmmakers alive. Perhaps all of these allegiances are
            at
            the
            root
            of why "Multiverse of Madness" never develops its own identity and depth. It's a Frankenmovie, a blockbuster
            sewn
            together from pieces of other films, comic books, and TV shows and given life with the electricity of a
            Marvel
            budget.
            After a dreadfully long build-up, "Doctor Strange 2" gains some momentum thanks to Raimi's visual flair, but
            even
            that
            runs out. You really can't go home again.

        <p>Spoilers will be very light. Don't worry.</p>

            Dr. Stephen Strange is attending the wedding of his unrequited love Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) when
            chaos
            erupts
            in the street outside (and the fact that Michael Stuhlbarg's name is on the poster for his single,
            early-movie
            scene
            at
            the wedding feels like an agent's coup). A massive octopus-like creature is chasing a girl named America
            Chavez
            (Xochitl
            Gomez) across dimensions, causing chaos along the way. Strange and Wong (Benedict Wong) leap into action to
            save
            the
            girl and learn that America is sought for her ability to traverse alternate universes, although she can't
            really
            control
            when she does so. Strange suspects that witchcraft may be involved, which leads him to seek the guidance of
            Wanda
            (Elizabeth Olsen), who is still reeling from the loss of her children at the end of the Disney+ show and
            under
            the
            spell
            of the evil Darkhold, a book of evil spells that Raimi fans will probably note looks a lot like the
            Necronomicon.
            Wanda
            is willing to do whatever it takes to live in the universe where she still has her children (although
            Vision's
            existence
            is barely referenced), which unleashes chaos for Strange, Wong, and America that involves Mordo (Chiwetel
            Ejiofor),
            a
            few classic characters, and, well, some new faces with familiar names.

            There's a sequence relatively early in "Multiverse of Madness" wherein Strange and America fly through
            alternate
            universes, including one that looks animated and one where their bodies are made of paint. I got excited. I
            thought
            after what felt like an interminable set-up that Raimi and company were about to blow up the Marvel formula
            machine
            and
            make a live-action film that felt like "Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse." Imagine that. A visual artist
            like
            Raimi
            with a modern MCU budget and complete creative freedom.

            You'll have to imagine it because this movie isn't interested in that kind of potential. "Multiverse of
            Madness"
            is
            a
            film that constantly pushes back against its own possibilities. It's got a plot that could have creatively
            surprised
            viewers over and over with new variations on the very concept of a world with heroes in it and a director
            willing to
            go
            there. But it's very clearly a product of a content machine, fighting against its own self-interests because
            it's
            scared
            to alienate any of the millions of potential viewers. The sense that these movies only feign interest in
            being
            "strange"
            when they're about as normal as can be makes them all the more frustrating. Both "WandaVision" and "Loki"
            took
            more
            creative risks. Significantly.

            Which makes it a double-edged sword when the Sam Raimi who directed "Spider-Man 2" and "Evil Dead 2" comes
            out
            to
            play
            about halfway through and then really gets going in the final act. Without spoilers, "Multiverse of Madness"
            starts
            to
            involve the walking dead, and the Raimi who revolutionized the horror genre proves he still has some life
            left
            in
            him.
            There are some creatively staged and executed action sequences in "Multiverse of Madness" that only could
            have
            been
            made
            by the director of "Drag Me to Hell," and those moments are easily the film's highlights and almost rescue
            it.
            One
            just
            wishes it didn't take so long to get to them and that they weren't tethered to a movie that too often
            doesn't
            have
            any
            idea what to do with that energy.
        </p>

        <p>
            Instead of letting "Multiverse of Madness" take creative flight, the story keeps coming back to incredibly
            shallow
            character traits like Wanda's grief, Strange's unspoken love for Christine, or America's uncertainty about
            her
            own
            powers. None of these resonate. The character arcs here are so remarkably weak that the performances suffer
            too.
            Cumberbatch is fine, but he's a victim of a film that's so plot-heavy that he's mostly just running from one
            CGI
            sequence to the next. And I'm eager to see what the charismatic Gomez can do with a much stronger character.
            Listen,
            I
            know MCU movies aren't generally places for deep character workâ€”I'm just saying it's even more shallow here
            than
            normal,
            especially considering how the typically reliable Olsen nailed this character in her previous outing. It's
            sad
            to
            see
            her and the character take a step back instead of exploring the ideas in the show that bore her name.

            By the time that "Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness" was pulling out the universe-bending scenes
            that
            will
            probably be spoiled by Friday afternoon, I started to wonder if there's a breaking point to these CGI orgies
            that
            serve
            so many other properties they forget to be interesting on their own. There have been complaints about MCU
            properties
            that feel like they exist merely to get people interested in the next movie or TV show, but it's never felt
            so
            much
            like
            a snake eating its own tail as it does here. Or at least the spell has worn off for me.
