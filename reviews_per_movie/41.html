        The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild has a target audience and, for them at least, it hits its mark.
        It was a little less than twenty years ago that 20th Century Fox Studios (and later 20th Century Studios)
        brought
        together prehistoric creatures in an animated film called Ice Age. The film documented the travels of Manny, the
        wooly
        mammoth (Ray Romano; Everybody Loves Raymond), and his new "friends" as they cross dangerous terrain to return a
        human
        baby to its family. Along the way, Manny, Diego - a saber-toothed tiger without a pack (Denis Leary; The Amazing
        Spider-man) and Sid - an annoying sloth (John Leguizamo; Moulin Rouge!) somehow form a bond and become their own
        pack/family. Two decades and five sequels later, The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild premieres on Disney+ this
        week.

        While the beloved characters Manny, Diego, Syd, and Ellie return for this sixth movie, they are minor
        characters, as the
        focus this time around is on Ellie's opossum brothers, Crash (Vincent Tong; Mega-Man: Fully Charged) and Eddie
        (newcomer
        Aaron Harris). Tired of being mothered by Ellie, the brothers head out on their own, looking for their own,
        personal
        bachelor pad. However, when they wander into the underground lost world, they run into their friend, Buck (Simon
        Pegg;
        Mission: Impossible Franchise), and stumble into a power struggle for control of the lost world between Buck and
        his
        long-time nemesis, Orson (Utkarsh Ambudkar; Free Guy).

    <p>
        It is nice that Crash and Eddie get their moment in the spotlight, and we are once again excited by the
        daredevil
        character of Bucky, however, the script and storyline needed quite a bit of "tweaking" that it, sadly didn't
        get.
        Halfway through the movie, one could practically recite the lines since you pretty much know what is coming
        next. Most
        of the jokes fall flat and become cringe-worthy after a while. If there is any saving grace, it is the new
        character,
        Zee (Justina Machado; The Purge: Anarchy), a sassy, female adventurer who goes toe to toe with Buck.

        With the closing of Blue Sky Studios, animating the movie fell upon Bardel Entertainment, who are known more for
        their
        animated television (Ricky and Morty, Teen Titans Go!) than they are for movies. Looking at it now, that makes
        perfect
        sense as the animation seemed rushed and messy, and it felt a little like a Saturday morning cartoon. The colors
        are
        deep and rich but still, there is a feeling that there is something missing.
    </p>

    <p>
        The animation, however, isn't the only thing missing. None of the voice talents, aside from Pegg, returned for
        this
        latest installment. Romano, Leary, Leguizamo, Queen Latifah (The Equalizer), etc. have seemingly left the
        franchise and
        have been replaced by mostly unknown actors trying to do their best impressions of their predecessors and not
        pulling it
        off well. Even Crash and Eddie aren't the original actors but, since their voices are as distinctive as the
        others, it
        isn't as noticeable. The final omission is probably the one that cuts the deepest. One of the best features of
        the Ice
        age movies is the shorts featuring Scrat (Chris Wedge; Robots), a saber-toothed squirrel always chasing his
        elusive
        acorns. Those scenes/shorts are some of the funniest in the entire franchise.

        The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild has a target audience and, for them at least, it hits its mark. I can
        imagine
        families watching this movie together and the youngest members running and jumping around excited for acrobatics
        displayed by Buck, Zee, Crash, and Eddie. Sadly, anyone over the age of six will mostly like want to take a nap
        but
        won't be able to as the screeches and squeals of delight coming from their little ones simply won't allow for
        rest.
