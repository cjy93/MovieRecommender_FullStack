        There are moments in “Men” that will cause your breath to quicken and your heart to pound. Still others will
        leave
        you
        scratching your head and stifling laughter.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whatever your reaction is to the latest meticulously made mind warp from writer/director Alex Garland, it won’t
        be
        indifference. This is a visceral experience, and it reinforces Garland’s singular prowess as a craftsman of
        indelible
        visuals and gripping mood. As in his previous films, “Ex Machina” and “Annihilation,” he establishes a feeling
        of
        dread
        early and holds you in it, unyielding, for much of the film’s duration. The methodical pacing, eerie
        cinematography,
        startling sound design, and vivid visual effects all work in synergy to create an almost merciless tension. But
        then
        we
        reach his wild, muscular climax—and that’s where things ultimately fall apart.
    </p>


    <p>
        “Men” is at its mightiest as a haunting exploration of grief, as it trudges an arduous road toward healing. The
        English
        countryside where our heroine seeks refuge after a horrifying loss looks peaceful and inviting. The lush woods
        are
        quiet
        and cool, as they so often are in Garland’s films—until they aren’t. The stately manor she’s rented offers far
        more
        space than she needs—until she has nowhere to hide. Jessie Buckley navigates the many perils that await her
        character,
        Harper, with an unease that eventually rises to terror. Her feelings are all there on the surface, and she’s
        dragging us
        along with her as she fights for her sanity as well as her safety. There’s an honesty and immediacy to her
        performance—to her screen presence in general—that keep us hanging on even as “Men” becomes increasingly
        unfocused.
    </p>

    <p>
        Harper has escaped to this idyllic village after experiencing a profound tragedy, which we witness in
        mesmerizing
        slow
        motion under orangey, stormy skies at the film’s start. But although she’s driven four hours outside her home in
        London,
        it doesn’t take long for her to discover that she’s placed herself at the center of a different kind of trauma.
        There’s
        something wrong with this place, with these people, who all happen to be ... men. One particular man, to be more
        precise, in a variety of forms. He’s the caretaker, the vicar, the bartender, the policeman and—in his most
        disturbing
        forms—the naked stalker and the surly teenager. (The facial CGI on that kid seems to be intentionally imperfect
        to
        make
        him even more off-putting than the rest.) He is Rory Kinnear, longtime character actor showing off his
        impressive
        versatility in a wide array of roles. Hair and makeup effects allow him to assume each new character distinctly,
        but
        he
        always maintains an unmistakably menacing air. Because no matter who this guy is, he lets her down—or worse—over
        and
        over again. Whether it’s a dismissal or a sexist insult, a passive-aggressive remark or a straight-up aggressive
        attack,
        he just keeps coming, each incarnation more dangerous than the last. How Harper deals with the onslaught becomes
        her
        own
        personal hell—and ours.
    </p>


    <p>
        There’s a line we cross in “Men” where it becomes clear we’ve left reality entirely. For a while, it’s possible
        that
        Harper’s just paranoid, as in one quietly powerful scene in which she sends her voice echoing playfully down an
        empty
        tunnel, only to discover that perhaps it’s not empty after all. But in time, we’re in full-on hallucination
        zone,
        and
        dazzlingly so. “Men” buzzes and builds to a frenzy in ways that are reminiscent of Darren Aronofsky’s “mother!”,
        which
        divided audiences the way Garland’s film surely will. Working with his usual cinematographer, Rob Hardy, and
        composers,
        Geoff Barrow and Ben Salisbury, as well as editor Jake Roberts, Garland creates a symphony of controlled chaos.
    </p>


    <p>
        And yet, while the film’s technical excellence is without question, the themes Garland is exploring are a bit
        hazier.
        What is he trying to say about the trials women must withstand within the patriarchy? He introduces biblical
        imagery
        early and often: Harper literally plucks an apple from a tree in the garden and takes a bite upon arrival at the
        manor.
        Is he suggesting that nothing has changed in 2,000-plus years of male-female relations? Later still, he inserts
        some
        ritualistic pagan imagery to hammer home that we are indeed watching old-school, ‘70s British folk horror, if
        nothing
        else. And how does all this relate to the film’s shocking, graphic, and downright bizarre conclusion, which
        keeps
        going
        and going to the extent that it inspires unintentional laughter? Bringing these ideas into sharper focus would
        have
        given them far more power. Instead, they meander and sprawl, remaining intriguing but tantalizingly out of
        reach.
    </p>

    <p>
        Still, this is the stuff of nightmares, and Garland shows you things here that you’ll never be able to unsee—but
        you
        will enjoy discussing them afterward with a friend over coffee or a drink. The lobbies of arthouse theaters
        worldwide
        are sure to be full of people wandering from their auditoriums in a daze, wondering what they just witnessed and
        wishing
        desperately to make sense of it. So maybe “Men” are good for something after all: They might just save cinema.
