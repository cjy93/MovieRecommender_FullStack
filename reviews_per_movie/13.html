        Science fiction author David Brin says there is just one reason for time travel: “Make it didn’t happen.” The
        idea
        of
        correcting, no, preventing one mistake is an irresistible fantasy. And whether it's about protecting the future
        mother
        of the only hero who can lead a rebellion against Skynet or making sure your own parents fall in love so that
        you
        and
        your siblings will be born, the movies have given us some of our favorite stories of rescue operations by
        traveling
        through time. “The Adam Project” is a popcorn pleasure from the director and the star of last year’s “Free Guy.”
    </p>

    <p>
        It begins with a banger, indeed one of the banger-iest songs of all time, Spencer Davis Group’s 1966 “Gimme Some
        Lovin’.” It is not there to tell us where we are in time or anything about rocket ship pilot Adam Reed (Ryan
        Reynolds).
        No matter, it’s just there to bring a jolt of energy as we join the story mid-chase. We know Reynolds can play
        other
        characters, but here he is what he does most and best, a snarky action hero. “What are you doing, Captain?” the
        instantly recognizable voice of Catherine Keener asks over speaker. “I think it’s pretty obvious I’m stealing
        this
        jet.”
        We are told that it is 2050 and time travel exists but we don’t know it yet. And we can see that Adam is in
        trouble.
        Both he and the ship have been hit. “I’m sorry to interrupt what I’m sure is going to be a really scary threat,”
        he
        says
        as he jams her tracking system and evades capture by escaping through a wormhole that takes him back to 2022.
    </p>


    <p>
        Meanwhile, in the present, Adam Reed, age 12 (Walker Scobell), is getting suspended for the third time for
        fighting
        with
        a bully. He and his mother (Jennifer Garner as Ellie) are still mourning for Adam’s father, who was killed in a
        car
        accident more than a year before, and he is angry about that, about being small for his age, about pretty much
        everything and so he is very big with the snarky comebacks, even when he knows it means a beating.
    </p>

    <p>
        Big Adam arrives at Young Adam’s house (his old house), injured, with a damaged ship. Reynolds and Scobell are a
        terrific match, with the same rhythms, both in observation and in snark. They also have the same scar under
        their
        chins
        and the same watch, their dad’s watch. It does not take long for Young Adam to figure out he is talking to his
        future
        self. It takes a little longer for Big Adam to realize that his younger self deserves some compassion. While he
        tells
        Young Adam that it is all of the trauma he experiences that will give him the strength and cynicism he relies on
        as
        an
        adult, he learns that maybe a little less trauma will be beneficial to them both.

    </p>
    <p>
        It also does not take long for the bad guys to arrive, along with two key figures I will not spoil. “The Adam
        Project”
        deftly balances the action with the comedy inherent in conflict between the two Adams. Both versions of Adam are
        exceptionally good at getting on the nerves of everyone around them, and it's fun to see how they are at the
        same
        time
        irritated by and appreciative of each other’s smart-aleck comebacks. Big Adam does not want to be reminded about
        how
        unhappy and angry he was as a 12-year-old. Young Adam is as thrilled at the prospect of growing up to look like
        Ryan
        Reynolds as he is to learn that there is such a thing as time travel and ride in a real space ship. He does not
        understand how unhappy and angry his future self is, but we do.

        The characters make references to “The Terminator” and “Back to the Future” but the film also draws from the
        underrated
        “Frequency” and from stories going back to the myth of Orpheus. And fans of “13 Going on 30” will appreciate
        seeing
        Garner and Mark Ruffalo as a devoted couple. (Ruffalo unfortunately does not have any scenes with co-star Zoe
        Saldaña,
        who played his wife in the indie gem “Infinitely Polar Bear.”)
    </p>

    <p>
        The film more than delivers on the promise of its premise with better-than-expected production design from
        Claude
        Paré
        for the futuristic gizmos and special effects by Scanline VFX for the way they are deployed. The action and
        fight
        scenes
        are very well staged, especially one with a tender reunion in the midst of the mayhem. Big Adam’s warming to his
        younger
        version gives the story some heart in the midst of the mayhem as well. There is genuine tenderness in his
        realization
        that anger does not prevent sadness and that second chances are possible. The action and fantasy are fun, but
        this
        is
        what families will want to talk about after they watch it together.
