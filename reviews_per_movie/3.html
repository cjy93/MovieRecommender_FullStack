        Adam Sandler is arguably the most basketball affiliated movie star working today. The love of the game was
        evident
        in
        his standup days, when he had that great bit about Wilt Chamberlain scoring 100 points in one game. Who could
        forget
        the
        immortal Lakers game scene in 2011's "Jack and Jill." Okay, maybe not. But what about his amazing turn as a
        degenerate
        gambler obsessing on "this is how I win" betting on NBA games and players in 2019's ultra-stressful "Uncut
        Gems."
    </p>

    <p>
        In his latest Netflix picture, "Hustle," Sandler returns to the boards, and in its opening minutes, the boards
        are
        all
        around the world. Sandler plays Stanley Sugarman, a talent scout for the Philadelphia 76ers. He's on and off
        planes
        and
        in and out of hotels, watching locals all over the states and in Europe. He eats badly—"You're killing
        yourself,"
        his
        wife, Teresa (Queen Latifah) says to him on a Zoom call. "That's the idea," he responds wryly.

    </p>


    <p>
        Stanley feeling bad about himself is more subtext than text in Sandler's disciplined, low-key portrayal. At a
        meeting
        with the team owner Rex Merrick (Robert Duvall), Stanley strongly urges not signing a German player. Rex's son
        Vince
        (Ben Foster, bearded and head shaven, signaling a real lack of vanity, as he looks appropriately ridiculous)
        wants
        the
        guy, and Stanley backs down. Rex notices this before awarding Stanley a coveted assistant coach job.
    </p>

    <p>
        The gig doesn't last. Rex passes away, Vince takes over, and the twerp demotes Stanley, instructing him he can
        get
        the
        coaching gig back if he goes back on the road and finds a missing piece.
    </p>

    <p>
        In Mallorca, Spain, Stanley is entertained by an old friend who wants him to become an agent. No way says
        Stanley.
        He
        wants that assistant coach job back. Hanging on to a dream? "Guys in their fifties don't have dreams," he says.
        "They
        have nightmares and eczema. And yet. In Spain he sees a local player who's got the stuff. Bo Cruz (Juancho
        Hernangomez,
        a real-life player currently with the Utah Jazz), a tall drink of water with a lot of raw talent, a bit of a
        temper,
        and
        as we learn later, a rap sheet. Vince is resistant, Stanley brings the player to the States anyway, and is soon
        freelance.
    </p>

        At this point, the movie, directed by Jeremiah Zagar, turns into a variation of "Rocky" had it been told from
        the
        point
        of view of coach Mickey Goldmill (Burgess Meredith). Putting his family's life on the line—fortunately his wife
        and
        teen
        daughter believe in him—he works at sanding down Bo's rough edges, doing stair runs in the wilds of South
        Philly,
        and
        teaching Bo how to handle trash talk, which proves a rather persistent issue. Once Bo reaches a certain goal
        Stanley
        even exclaims "Yeah, Rocky!"
    </p>


    <p>
        Bo and Stanley find themselves at the receiving end of a spiteful betrayal just as Bo is slated to show the
        basketball
        world what he's got. You could call this a process film with twists—and of course with a feel-good conclusion.
        The
        solution to one of Bo's problems is very 21st century, combined with the clout to book all-star cameos—Stanley's
        daughter Alex, who's looking to go to film school, contrives to make some viral video of Bo in action,
        introduced by
        Julius "Dr. J." Irving himself.
    </p>

    <p>
        If "Hustle" passes around a lot of sports movie cliches, it does so with a light touch. And its sense of
        atmosphere,
        and
        depiction of Stanley's milieu, is sensitive and knowing, But be warned: this movie is VERY basketball-oriented.
        If
        you're not a fan, you might feel a little lost. The movie's got a nearly two-hour running time, and let me tell
        you,
        the
        roster of NBA players and luminaries who appear as themselves or in character roles that end the movie is pretty
        long.
        For a minute I actually wondered if Jordan Hull, who plays Stanley and Teresa's crafty daughter, was a WNBA
        player
        herself. She is not. However, a guy named Jordan Hulls currently plays pro basketball in Germany. Just so you
        know.
