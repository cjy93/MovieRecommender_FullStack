            With romance callously sliced up into right and left swipes, dating has long been an undignified concept in
            the
            online world. You could even call it a meat market—sure, it’s a clichéd phrase, but what cliché isn’t rooted
            in
            some
            truth?
        </p>

        <p>
            In debuting director Mimi Cave’s entertaining and bonkers satirical horror “Fresh,” Noa knows all about the
            losers
            on the bland menu of her endless app scrolls—it’s understandable that she has lost her taste for kissing the
            frogs.
            Still, our modern West Coaster—charismatically played by “Normal People” breakout Daisy Edgar-Jones—refuses
            to
            give
            up optimism and puts herself out there courageously, scarf-wearing douche-y dudes be damned! It’s through
            her
            sweet
            hopefulness that she passes on countless faux-cool profile photos during one such evening of mindless
            browsing,
            and
            reaches out to someone sporting a cute dog picture as his avatar. But what thanks does she get for her
            curiosity?
            Nothing, just a gross dick picture sent by your average creeper.
        </p>

        <p>
            We get introduced to Noa in a pitch-perfect opening scene during a horrendous date with one of those
            aforesaid
            scarf-wearers. A cheapskate (“Bring cash,” he reminds Noa before the date even takes place), Chad chews his
            noodles
            while spewing all sorts of stomach-churning vitriol. “You would look great in a dress,” he rudely tells the
            sweater-donned Noa, putting her down for not being into femininity “like the women of his parents’
            generation.”
            He
            insults their waitress with blatant racism. He feels entitled enough to grab all the leftovers, not hold the
            door
            for Noa (What happened to all that “parents’ generation” talk?) and calls her a stuck-up bitch when his
            reach
            for a
            kiss doesn’t get reciprocated. So can you really blame Noa for rapidly buying into the grand gestures of
            Sebastian
            Stan’s traditional charmer Steve on the heels of this disastrous evening and falling to bed with him?
        </p>

        <p>
            You can’t—hey, it’s the ever-appealing Stan we’re talking about—but you are allowed to raise a slight
            eyebrow
            when
            this practical woman completely trusts a perfect stranger she only just met at a supermarket aisle, by
            allowing
            him
            to whisk her away to a surprise weekend getaway to an unknown location. Thankfully, her droll, bisexual
            best-friend
            Mollie (a terrific Jojo T. Gibbs) who seems to have given up on men completely, has much sharper instincts.
            No
            social media footprint? Not even an Instagram page as someone who claims to be a plastic surgeon? To Mollie,
            these
            are all red flags.
        </p>


        <p>
            They will seem shady enough to the viewers too, thanks to Lauryn Kahn’s zippy script and Cave’s visual
            language
            that, in unison, suggest enough of an unease beneath Steve’s casual allure. To the careful ear, “I don’t eat
            animals” from his lips will ring one or two alarm bells. (Why not just say, “I’m a vegetarian?”) Other clues
            will
            hint shades of this mystery man’s unusual tastebuds, too. But it’s not until the title card “Fresh” appears
            more
            than 30 minutes into the film that they will be spelled out for all their grotesqueness. (Speaking of
            late-emerging
            title cards, if “Drive My Car” was a bridge too far for you in that department, wait until “Fresh” sneakily
            asserts,
            “Hold my Old Fashioned!”)
        </p>


        <p>
            While the surprising twist from this point on is what’s sickly fun about “Fresh,” it’s near-impossible to
            talk
            about
            this movie without spoiling it to some degree. So read everything below at your own risk, knowing that your
            first-time experience with the film will be irreparably altered if you do so. Here it goes: Steve is in fact
            a
            cold-blooded liar as well as a cannibal, satisfying the needs of his ridiculously rich human-flesh-eating
            clientele
            by selling them processed female meat. Noa is just the latest one of his victims who has taken the bait. But
            something seems to be different about his approach to her, as she quickly learns through cell-to-cell inmate
            banter
            in the ruthless Bluebeard’s dungeon. He seems to actually like Noa, and maybe there is a way for her to use
            her
            infectious smile and enchanting femininity to outsmart this serial killer.
        </p>

        <p>
            I’m making it all sound a lot more serious than it actually is. Know that the irresistibility of “Fresh”
            lies in
            the
            fact that it doesn’t take itself too seriously—all things considered, the film manages to stay light on its
            feet
            with its “Hostel” meets “Ex Machina” concept, mostly avoiding overt, self-righteous preachiness in its
            moderately-feminist tale where women’s bodies are perishable commodity. In this regard, Cave and her
            cinematographer
            Pawel Pogorzelski (a repeat Ari Aster collaborator) offer up a buffet of outlandishly gross but brightly lit
            visual
            tidbits of men savoring their pricey meals, keeping the mood nimble and wacky. Still, a huge part of the
            credit
            belongs to Stan, who goes all in on a maniacal performance that’s often laugh-out-loud funny, even when the
            actor
            leans a bit heavily towards Christian Bale’s “American Psycho” mannerisms on occasion. (Two fiendishly
            comical
            scenes accompanied by Peter Cetera’s “Restless Heart” and Animotion’s “Obsession” come to mind.) Gibbs is
            also
            the
            film’s secret weapon—while her character is dangerously close to a stock “supportive black best friend” on
            the
            page,
            Gibbs defies the clichés and claims Mollie as her own.
        </p>

        <p>
            Still, the interpretation of race in “Fresh” leaves a lot to be desired—there is something to be said about
            a
            carelessly privileged white woman dragging her savvy black friend into harm’s way. Also under-explored are
            the
            motivations of Charlotte Le Bon’s Ann—as Steve’s wife (and possibly one of his former victims), this
            self-interest-focused white traitor clearly feels no responsibility towards her own gender, an idea that
            Kahn’s
            script only vaguely teases and then abandons in its untidy (and increasingly gory) final act. But perhaps
            these
            are
            concerns for a meatier film. In the meantime, allow the tongue-in-cheek “Fresh” to satisfy your appetite for
            a
            generous helping of heartening sisterhood and eradicate your cravings for a juicy burger, possibly forever.
