        "Hotel Transylvania: Transformania," the fourth in the animated series about the vampire who runs a residential
        hotel for monsters, is the brightest, funniest, sweetest, and all-around best one yet. Roger Ebert liked to
        describe
        movies as “empathy machines.” “Hotel Transylvania: Transformania” is a good example. The struggle of monsters
        and
        humans to understand each other is taken to its ultimate stage by switching places thanks to a transforming ray
        that
        works and then breaks, leaving them stuck that way until they can find a replacement just in time for a happy
        ending.
    </p>


    <p>
        Devoted single dad Drac (Brian Hull replacing Adam Sandler) has never been comfortable with his human son-in-law
        Johnny (Andy Samberg). It is more than just the difference between monsters and humans. Drac is by nature
        restrained, anxious, and resistant to change while Johnny is ebullient, adventuresome, and impulsive. As the
        movie
        opens, the hotel is celebrating the 125th anniversary of the hotel and Drag is getting ready to turn the hotel
        over
        to his daughter, Mavis (Selena Gomez, now producer of the film as well as star) and Johnny. But Johnny’s
        enthusiastic reaction and plans for changes make him reconsider. Drac lies to Johnny, telling him he would give
        them
        the hotel, but. “real estate law” forbids transfer of property to a human. Johnny does not want to disappoint
        Mavis,
        so he impulsively visits the basement lab of mad scientist Van Helsing (Jim Gaffigan), who happens to have a
        transforming ray on hand. Prudently, he first tests it on an actual guinea pig. Satisfied with the monster-fied
        results, he trains it on Johnny, who is delighted with his new dragon-like monster self.
    </p>


    <p>
        When the ray accidentally hits Drac, though, the results are not nearly as welcome. No powers! No fangs!
        Receding
        hairline! And worst of all, a dad bod! Talk about terrifying! The magic monster-making crystal breaks, and the
        only
        way to return them to their original forms is to find another one, following a monster-ific GPS to a rainforest
        in
        South America. And so, it is a road movie, with two very different people, now suddenly different from their own
        selves as well as from each other, learning to work together along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
        That is part of what makes it so much fun, because the characters are so far from their most fundamental sense
        of
        who they are. Drac goes from frustrated fury at not being able to fly or use mind control, to delight at
        experiencing what seems very ordinary to us—sunlight. He may be a vampire, but he is horrified when he is
        confronted
        by another species of blood-sucker—mosquitos.
    </p>


    <p>
        The animation is exceptionally detailed, supple and dynamic. The interplay of the images with the action and
        dialogue adds emphasis and clever twists that will reward a second and third viewing. There is a lively
        plasticity
        to the characters that is exaggerated enough to take advantage of the animator’s unlimited imagination while
        staying
        completely consistent with the internal reality of the world where, after three other movies plus shorts and
        video
        games with these characters, we feel at home. The gestures and facial expressions are hilarious but always in
        service of story and character.
    </p>


    <p>
        And the animators have a blast with the various transformations. After three movies, it's a lot of fun to see
        the
        human side of the other monsters. And that means “see” in the most literal sense. Griffin the Invisible Man
        (David
        Spade) had been nothing but a pair of glasses until his transformation; his friends are surprised to find out
        he’d
        been naked the whole time. For Griffin himself, the equally disconcerting surprise is that he is balding. We
        also
        learn what, or rather who, has been inside the thousands-of-years-old wrapping around Murray the Mummy
        (Keegan-Michael Key) and what Wayne the Wolfman (Steve Buscemi) looks like without all the fur (though still
        pretty
        hairy). The un-pieced-together Frankenstein (Brad Abrell) turns out to be a selfie-taking dreamboat. At least he
        thinks so. His wife, Eunice (Fran Drescher) is not convinced.
    </p>

    <p>
        Gomez’s wry, understated delivery made her a perfect foil for Steve Martin and Martin Short in the Hulu series
        “Only
        Murders in the Building.” Here it works well as the voice of reason in the midst of all of the insanity, and she
        adds enough warmth to show her love for both Johnny and Drac. She and Ericka Van Helsing (Kathryn Hahn) bring
        the
        other wives to chase after the monster/humans and human/monster (in a zeppelin!) to find the crystal before it's
        too
        late to transform back.
    </p>


    <p>
        With its Indiana Jones-style adventure, "Hotel Transylvania: Transformania" combines monster powers lost and
        found
        (love those innumerable wolf cubs), pure joyous silliness, and surprisingly touching insights into family
        relationships. My Yelp review for this hotel is “would do business again.”
