        Janus Metz's “All the Old Knives” observes two former lovers who reunite after being separated for eight years
        and who,
        over the course of a long afternoon and evening in a fancy restaurant, reminisce about the time they spent
        together in
        Vienna. Lest you think the resulting film is going to be some kind of hybrid of “My Dinner with Andre” and
        “Before
        Sunrise,” it should be noted that the period of time under discussion occurred when both were working for the
        CIA, and
        there's the distinct probability one of them may have been a mole whose actions led to mass casualties. It's an
        intriguing idea for a film, I suppose, but it proves to be pretty much all setup with precious little
        follow-through.
        Not even the good performances from the two leads can make the whole thing work.
    </p>


    <p>
        Eight years ago, a plane was hijacked in Vienna and the members of the CIA station there—including agents Henry
        Pelham
        (Chris Pine) and Celia Harrison (Thandiwe Newton) and superiors Vick Wallinger (Laurence Fishburne) and Bill
        Compton
        (Jonathan Pryce)—pursued any and all possible leads to try to figure out a way to defuse the situation before
        blood was
        shed. This failed and all 120 people on board, terrorists and hostages alike, were killed. Now, new information
        has come
        to light suggesting there was a mole in the office who may have secretly provided information to the terrorists.
        Henry
        is charged with interviewing the surviving members of the group—one mysteriously committed suicide a couple of
        months
        after the incident—to see if he can ferret out which one is guilty.
    </p>

    <p>
        Which leads to the reunion in a fancy restaurant in Carmel-by-the-Sea between the former lovers. They have not
        seen each
        other since Celia took off in the wake of the tragedy, and after the requisite catching-up banter and perhaps a
        hint of
        low-grade flirting, their discussion turns to eight years earlier. The film then uses parallel timelines,
        cutting
        between the current conversation between Henry and Celia and extended flashbacks showing what they were doing
        during the
        crisis. It soon becomes clear at least one of them knows more about what happened than they are letting on, and
        that the
        sumptuous feast they have been consuming will most likely prove to be the last meal for at least one of them.
    </p>


    <p>
        As espionage narratives go, “All the Old Knives,” which is based on the novel by Olen Steinhauer (who also wrote
        the
        screenplay), is closer to the more cerebral and realistic creations of John le Carré than the comic book
        fantasies of
        James Bond (underscored perhaps a bit too bluntly at one point where Henry attempts to order a vodka martini and
        is
        rebuffed). The early set-up scenes are reasonably intriguing but at a certain point, things just stop working.
        One key
        problem is that the flashback structure never quite works and ends up halting any dramatic tension practically
        every
        time it goes back and forth in time. Another is that the big center mystery proves to be not much of anything—at
        a
        certain point, it becomes fairly obvious what the answer is and when all is finally revealed, the revelation and
        subsequent explanation is somewhat of a letdown.
    </p>

    <p>
        This makes “All the Old Knives” somewhat frustrating, especially when this meh material is delivered by a group
        of
        strong actors. Newton is, of course, one of today's more commanding performers, and she invests Celia with
        enough
        determination and vulnerability to make the character more complex than the material has managed. Likewise, Pine
        is good
        as Henry and, along with his recent turn in the otherwise disappointing “The Contractor,” demonstrates an
        unexpected
        sense of gravitas that suggests he has the soul of a character actor burning within him. And while their parts
        do not
        really add up to much in the long run, old pros Fishburne and Pryce help things out momentarily by the strength
        of their
        distinct presences alone.
    </p>

    <p>
        “All the Old Knives” is never much more than a film whose narrative curlicues cannot quite disguise just how
        familiar it
        all is. With mid-sized movies aimed primarily at adult-leaning audiences becoming increasingly rare amidst the
        glut of
        franchise properties, I would have loved to have celebrate it as a throwback. Alas, it feels more like one whose
        ultimate destiny is to languish on Amazon for those who can’t find anything better to watch.
