        The champagne is sparkling, the wood decks are gleaming, and the white linens are pressed to a crisp. The
        glittering
        cast of “Death on the Nile” is all dressed up but, alas, they have nowhere to go.
    </p>

    <p>
        Kenneth Branagh’s adaptation of the Agatha Christie murder mystery, the follow-up to his 2017 “Murder on the
        Orient
        Express,” finds the filmmaker once again behind the camera and in front of it as the legendary detective Hercule
        Poirot.
        And while it’s clear he’s having a ball as the elaborately mustachioed supersleuth, the journey for us isn’t
        quite as
        much escapist fun. There’s a distracting detachment at work here, both in the visual effects and performances.
        Individual moments from supporting players bring the film to life only sporadically. And while his A-list stars,
        Armie
        Hammer and Gal Gadot, may be impossibly beautiful, they’re both oddly stiff and have zero romantic chemistry
        with each
        other. (Hammer has other problems, off-screen, which we’ll get to in a moment.)
    </p>


    <p>
        “Orient Express” writer Michael Green returns to adapt the screenplay, and he’s made some tweaks, which provide
        some
        welcome diversity; Sophie Okonedo and Letitia Wright are the primary standouts among the ensemble cast. But it
        takes an
        awful long time for the proceedings to get going and the tension to begin mounting. Branagh and Green’s
        cleverest and
        most compelling move is the flashback they’ve attached at the start: a striking, black-and-white depiction of
        the young
        Poirot in the trenches of World War I, where he demonstrates the resourcefulness and sharp wit that will become
        his
        trademarks. A convincingly de-aged Branagh also allows us to witness the origin story of Poirot’s signature
        mustache,
        which launches the film on a note of shock and heartbreak. I would rather have watched the rest of that movie;
        it had
        texture and verve to it. Instead, we get “Death on the Nile.”
    </p>

    <p>
        Jumping ahead to 1937 London, we see the established and adored Poirot entering a packed and jumping blues club,
        where
        Okonedo’s Salome Otterbourne is performing on stage. Her niece, Wright’s Rosalie Otterbourne, is also her
        tough-as-nails
        manager. But there’s a show for Poirot to take in on the floor, as well: the handsome Simon Doyle (Hammer) and
        his
        vivacious fiancée, Jacqueline de Bellefort (Emma Mackey), are tearing it up with an erotic, acrobatic dance.
        Seeing
        Hammer introduced this way, in such an aggressively physical and sexual manner, makes it impossible to ignore
        the
        allegations of assault and abuse that several women have made against the actor. (He has denied them and said
        that
        whatever occurred within these relationships was consensual. Still, it’s hard to shake that unsettling feeling.)
    </p>


    <p>
        But once Jacqueline introduces Simon to her childhood friend, the ravishing heiress Linnet Ridgeway (Gadot), he
        only has
        eyes for her. And who could blame him? This is where Branagh’s choice to shoot in 65mm is particularly
        effective.
        Gadot’s entrance into the smoky club, in a drapey, metallic silver gown, is so dreamy and creamy, it’s richer in
        fantasy
        and escape than anything that happens later on the boat. In no time, Simon and Linnet are married, and Poirot
        finds
        himself swept up in their tony honeymoon celebration on the Nile while vacationing in Egypt.
    </p>


    <p>
        He's there at the insistence of his charming, old friend Bouc (Tom Bateman, reprising his “Orient Express”
        role), whose
        wealthy, painter mother, Euphemia (an enjoyable snarky Annette Bening), has come along for the adventure. Also
        aboard
        the SS Karnak are Linnet’s lawyer/cousin Katchadourian (Ali Fazal); her ex-fiancé (Russell Brand in an
        interestingly
        understated turn); her personal maid (Rose Leslie); and her godmother with her traveling nurse. They’re played
        by the
        longtime comedy duo of Jennifer Saunders and Dawn French, and you long to see what they’d do with this material
        if left
        to their own devices. The Otterbournes also have been invited to celebrate the Doyles’ nuptials since Salome was
        performing the night they met—and it’s a good thing, too, because Okonedo single-handedly steals this movie with
        her
        perfectly delivered zingers. Again, I want a movie about that character.
    </p>

    <p>
        And there’s an uninvited guest who keeps showing up, first at the hotel and later on the ship: the jilted
        Jackie,
        stalking the newlyweds and causing yet another reason for everyone to hover about, eavesdropping and side-eying
        in
        various well-appointed parlors. With her wide, brown eyes, Mackey brings just the right amount of crazy to the
        role. But
        as is the case with just about everyone in “Death on the Nile,” there’s not much to her beyond a couple of
        character
        traits. Brand, Fazal, French, and Leslie get especially short shrift. And so when there’s a murder—because of
        course
        there’s a murder whenever Hercule Poirot is around—this whodunit mostly becomes a who-cares. We learn far too
        little
        about these characters, even after the detective’s strategic questioning.
    </p>


    <p>
        Meanwhile, at the center of the movie where a passionate romance should be the driving force for thrills and
        suspense,
        there’s a giant hole shaped like Hammer and Gadot. They have absolutely no connection with each other physically
        or
        emotionally. Their timing and body language is all wrong. It’s impossible to believe these two people have
        fallen so
        intensely and spontaneously in love with each other that they’re willing to destroy an engagement (his) and a
        treasured
        friendship (hers) to be together.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can’t properly luxuriate in the scenery, either. So much of “Death on the Nile” looks empty and artificial—a
        glossy,
        CGI-rendered version of legitimately grand and impressive sights. At times, this may as well be “Death on the
        Nile: The
        Video Game.” Given how long the film has been delayed because of the pandemic, maybe that’s what it should have
        been.
